<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>chan</b>
<i>option</i> ?<i>arg arg ...</i>?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
provides several operations for reading from, writing to and
otherwise manipulating open channels (such as have been
created with the <b>open</b> and <b>socket</b> commands, or
the default named channels <b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b> or
<b>stderr</b> which correspond to the process&rsquo;s
standard input, output and error streams respectively).
<i>Option</i> indicates what to do with the channel; any
unique abbreviation for <i>option</i> is acceptable. Valid
options are: <b><br>
chan blocked</b> <i>channelId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This tests whether the last
input operation on the channel called <i>channelId</i>
failed because it would have otherwise caused the process to
block, and returns 1 if that was the case. It returns 0
otherwise. Note that this only ever returns 1 when the
channel has been configured to be non-blocking; all Tcl
channels have blocking turned on by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan close</b>
<i>channelId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Close and destroy the channel
called <i>channelId</i>. Note that this deletes all existing
file-events registered on the channel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">As part of
closing the channel, all buffered output is flushed to the
channel&rsquo;s output device, any buffered input is
discarded, the underlying operating system resource is
closed and <i>channelId</i> becomes unavailable for future
use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the channel
is blocking, the command does not return until all output is
flushed. If the channel is nonblocking and there is
unflushed output, the channel remains open and the command
returns immediately; output will be flushed in the
background and the channel will be closed when all the
flushing is complete.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>channelId</i> is a blocking channel for a command
pipeline then <b>chan close</b> waits for the child
processes to complete.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the channel
is shared between interpreters, then <b>chan close</b> makes
<i>channelId</i> unavailable in the invoking interpreter but
has no other effect until all of the sharing interpreters
have closed the channel. When the last interpreter in which
the channel is registered invokes <b>chan close</b> (or
<b>close</b>), the cleanup actions described above occur.
See the <b>interp</b> command for a description of channel
sharing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Channels are
automatically closed when an interpreter is destroyed and
when the process exits. Channels are switched to blocking
mode, to ensure that all output is correctly flushed before
the process exits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The command
returns an empty string, and may generate an error if an
error occurs while flushing output. If a command in a
command pipeline created with <b>open</b> returns an error,
<b>chan close</b> generates an error (similar to the
<b>exec</b> command.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan configure</b>
<i>channelId</i> ?<i>optionName</i>? ?<i>value</i>?
?<i>optionName value</i>?...</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Query or set the configuration
options of the channel named <i>channelId</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If no
<i>optionName</i> or <i>value</i> arguments are supplied,
the command returns a list containing alternating option
names and values for the channel. If <i>optionName</i> is
supplied but no <i>value</i> then the command returns the
current value of the given option. If one or more pairs of
<i>optionName</i> and <i>value</i> are supplied, the command
sets each of the named options to the corresponding
<i>value</i>; in this case the return value is an empty
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The options
described below are supported for all channels. In addition,
each channel type may add options that only it supports. See
the manual entry for the command that creates each type of
channels for the options that that specific type of channel
supports. For example, see the manual entry for the
<b>socket</b> command for its additional options. <b><br>
&minus;blocking</b> <i>boolean</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The <b>&minus;blocking</b>
option determines whether I/O operations on the channel can
cause the process to block indefinitely. The value of the
option must be a proper boolean value. Channels are normally
in blocking mode; if a channel is placed into nonblocking
mode it will affect the operation of the <b>chan gets</b>,
<b>chan read</b>, <b>chan puts</b>, <b>chan flush</b>, and
<b>chan close</b> commands; see the documentation for those
commands for details. For nonblocking mode to work
correctly, the application must be using the Tcl event loop
(e.g. by calling <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> or invoking the
<b>vwait</b> command).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;buffering</b>
<i>newValue</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If <i>newValue</i> is
<b>full</b> then the I/O system will buffer output until its
internal buffer is full or until the <b>chan flush</b>
command is invoked. If <i>newValue</i> is <b>line</b>, then
the I/O system will automatically flush output for the
channel whenever a newline character is output. If
<i>newValue</i> is <b>none</b>, the I/O system will flush
automatically after every output operation. The default is
for <b>&minus;buffering</b> to be set to <b>full</b> except
for channels that connect to terminal-like devices; for
these channels the initial setting is <b>line</b>.
Additionally, <b>stdin</b> and <b>stdout</b> are initially
set to <b>line</b>, and <b>stderr</b> is set to
<b>none</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;buffersize</b>
<i>newSize</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><i>Newvalue</i> must be an
integer; its value is used to set the size of buffers, in
bytes, subsequently allocated for this channel to store
input or output. <i>Newvalue</i> must be a number of no more
than one million, allowing buffers of up to one million
bytes in size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;encoding</b>
<i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This option is used to specify
the encoding of the channel as one of the named encodings
returned by <b>encoding names</b> or the special value
<b>binary</b>, so that the data can be converted to and from
Unicode for use in Tcl. For instance, in order for Tcl to
read characters from a Japanese file in <b>shiftjis</b> and
properly process and display the contents, the encoding
would be set to <b>shiftjis</b>. Thereafter, when reading
from the channel, the bytes in the Japanese file would be
converted to Unicode as they are read. Writing is also
supported &minus; as Tcl strings are written to the channel
they will automatically be converted to the specified
encoding on output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">If a file
contains pure binary data (for instance, a JPEG image), the
encoding for the channel should be configured to be
<b>binary</b>. Tcl will then assign no interpretation to the
data in the file and simply read or write raw bytes. The Tcl
<b>binary</b> command can be used to manipulate this
byte-oriented data. It is usually better to set the
<b>&minus;translation</b> option to <b>binary</b> when you
want to transfer binary data, as this turns off the other
automatic interpretations of the bytes in the stream as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">The default
encoding for newly opened channels is the same platform- and
locale-dependent system encoding used for interfacing with
the operating system, as returned by <b>encoding
system</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;eofchar</b>
<i>char</i> <b><br>
&minus;eofchar {</b><i>inChar outChar</i><b>}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This option supports DOS file
systems that use Control-z (\x1a) as an end of file marker.
If <i>char</i> is not an empty string, then this character
signals end-of-file when it is encountered during input. For
output, the end-of-file character is output when the channel
is closed. If <i>char</i> is the empty string, then there is
no special end of file character marker. For read-write
channels, a two-element list specifies the end of file
marker for input and output, respectively. As a convenience,
when setting the end-of-file character for a read-write
channel you can specify a single value that will apply to
both reading and writing. When querying the end-of-file
character of a read-write channel, a two-element list will
always be returned. The default value for
<b>&minus;eofchar</b> is the empty string in all cases
except for files under Windows. In that case the
<b>&minus;eofchar</b> is Control-z (\x1a) for reading and
the empty string for writing. The acceptable range for
<b>&minus;eofchar</b> values is \x01 - \x7f; attempting to
set <b>&minus;eofchar</b> to a value outside of this range
will generate an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;translation</b>
<i>mode</i> <b><br>
&minus;translation {</b><i>inMode outMode</i><b>}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">In Tcl scripts the end of a
line is always represented using a single newline character
(\n). However, in actual files and devices the end of a line
may be represented differently on different platforms, or
even for different devices on the same platform. For
example, under UNIX newlines are used in files, whereas
carriage-return-linefeed sequences are normally used in
network connections. On input (i.e., with <b>chan gets</b>
and <b>chan read</b>) the Tcl I/O system automatically
translates the external end-of-line representation into
newline characters. Upon output (i.e., with <b>chan
puts</b>), the I/O system translates newlines to the
external end-of-line representation. The default translation
mode, <b>auto</b>, handles all the common cases
automatically, but the <b>&minus;translation</b> option
provides explicit control over the end of line
translations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">The value
associated with <b>&minus;translation</b> is a single item
for read-only and write-only channels. The value is a
two-element list for read-write channels; the read
translation mode is the first element of the list, and the
write translation mode is the second element. As a
convenience, when setting the translation mode for a
read-write channel you can specify a single value that will
apply to both reading and writing. When querying the
translation mode of a read-write channel, a two-element list
will always be returned. The following values are currently
supported:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="10%">


<p><b>auto</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>As the input translation mode, <b>auto</b> treats any of
newline (<b>lf</b>), carriage return (<b>cr</b>), or
carriage return followed by a newline (<b>crlf</b>) as the
end of line representation. The end of line representation
can even change from line-to-line, and all cases are
translated to a newline. As the output translation mode,
<b>auto</b> chooses a platform specific representation; for
sockets on all platforms Tcl chooses <b>crlf</b>, for all
Unix flavors, it chooses <b>lf</b>, and for the various
flavors of Windows it chooses <b>crlf</b>. The default
setting for <b>&minus;translation</b> is <b>auto</b> for
both input and output.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="10%">


<p><b>binary</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>No end-of-line translations are performed. This is
nearly identical to <b>lf</b> mode, except that in addition
<b>binary</b> mode also sets the end-of-file character to
the empty string (which disables it) and sets the encoding
to <b>binary</b> (which disables encoding filtering). See
the description of <b>&minus;eofchar</b> and
<b>&minus;encoding</b> for more information.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="10%">


<p><b>cr</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>The end of a line in the underlying file or device is
represented by a single carriage return character. As the
input translation mode, <b>cr</b> mode converts carriage
returns to newline characters. As the output translation
mode, <b>cr</b> mode translates newline characters to
carriage returns.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="10%">


<p><b>crlf</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>The end of a line in the underlying file or device is
represented by a carriage return character followed by a
linefeed character. As the input translation mode,
<b>crlf</b> mode converts carriage-return-linefeed sequences
to newline characters. As the output translation mode,
<b>crlf</b> mode translates newline characters to
carriage-return-linefeed sequences. This mode is typically
used on Windows platforms and for network connections.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">

<p><b>lf</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>The end of a line in the underlying file or device is
represented by a single newline (linefeed) character. In
this mode no translations occur during either input or
output. This mode is typically used on UNIX platforms.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan copy</b> <i>inputChan
outputChan</i> ?<b>&minus;size</b> <i>size</i>?
?<b>&minus;command</b> <i>callback</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Copy data from the channel
<i>inputChan</i>, which must have been opened for reading,
to the channel <i>outputChan</i>, which must have been
opened for writing. The <b>chan copy</b> command leverages
the buffering in the Tcl I/O system to avoid extra copies
and to avoid buffering too much data in main memory when
copying large files to slow destinations like network
sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>chan
copy</b> command transfers data from <i>inputChan</i> until
end of file or <i>size</i> bytes have been transferred. If
no <b>&minus;size</b> argument is given, then the copy goes
until end of file. All the data read from <i>inputChan</i>
is copied to <i>outputChan</i>. Without the
<b>&minus;command</b> option, <b>chan copy</b> blocks until
the copy is complete and returns the number of bytes written
to <i>outputChan</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;command</b> argument makes <b>chan copy</b> work
in the background. In this case it returns immediately and
the <i>callback</i> is invoked later when the copy
completes. The <i>callback</i> is called with one or two
additional arguments that indicates how many bytes were
written to <i>outputChan</i>. If an error occurred during
the background copy, the second argument is the error string
associated with the error. With a background copy, it is not
necessary to put <i>inputChan</i> or <i>outputChan</i> into
non-blocking mode; the <b>chan copy</b> command takes care
of that automatically. However, it is necessary to enter the
event loop by using the <b>vwait</b> command or by using
Tk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">You are not
allowed to do other I/O operations with <i>inputChan</i> or
<i>outputChan</i> during a background <b>chan copy</b>. If
either <i>inputChan</i> or <i>outputChan</i> get closed
while the copy is in progress, the current copy is stopped
and the command callback is <i>not</i> made. If
<i>inputChan</i> is closed, then all data already queued for
<i>outputChan</i> is written out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<i>inputChan</i> can become readable during a background
copy. You should turn off any <b>chan event</b> or
<b>fileevent</b> handlers during a background copy so those
handlers do not interfere with the copy. Any I/O attempted
by a <b>chan event</b> or <b>fileevent</b> handler will get
a &ldquo;channel busy&rdquo; error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Chan
copy</b> translates end-of-line sequences in
<i>inputChan</i> and <i>outputChan</i> according to the
<b>&minus;translation</b> option for these channels (see
<b>chan configure</b> above). The translations mean that the
number of bytes read from <i>inputChan</i> can be different
than the number of bytes written to <i>outputChan</i>. Only
the number of bytes written to <i>outputChan</i> is
reported, either as the return value of a synchronous
<b>chan copy</b> or as the argument to the callback for an
asynchronous <b>chan copy</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Chan
copy</b> obeys the encodings and character translations
configured for the channels. This means that the incoming
characters are converted internally first UTF-8 and then
into the encoding of the channel <b>chan copy</b> writes to
(see <b>chan configure</b> above for details on the
<b>&minus;encoding</b> and <b>&minus;translation</b>
options). No conversion is done if both channels are set to
encoding <b>binary</b> and have matching translations. If
only the output channel is set to encoding <b>binary</b> the
system will write the internal UTF-8 representation of the
incoming characters. If only the input channel is set to
encoding <b>binary</b> the system will assume that the
incoming bytes are valid UTF-8 characters and convert them
according to the output encoding. The behaviour of the
system for bytes which are not valid UTF-8 characters is
undefined in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan create</b> <i>mode
cmdPrefix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This subcommand creates a new
script level channel using the command prefix
<i>cmdPrefix</i> as its handler. Any such channel is called
a <b>reflected</b> channel. The specified command prefix,
<b>cmdPrefix</b>, must be a non-empty list, and should
provide the API described in the <b>reflectedchan</b> manual
page. The handle of the new channel is returned as the
result of the <b>chan create</b> command, and the channel is
open. Use either <b>close</b> or <b>chan close</b> to remove
the channel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
<i>mode</i> specifies if the new channel is opened for
reading, writing, or both. It has to be a list containing
any of the strings &ldquo;<b>read</b>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;<b>write</b>&rdquo;. The list must have at least one
element, as a channel you can neither write to nor read from
makes no sense. The handler command for the new channel must
support the chosen mode, or an error is thrown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The command
prefix is executed in the global namespace, at the top of
call stack, following the appending of arguments as
described in the <b>reflectedchan</b> manual page. Command
resolution happens at the time of the call. Renaming the
command, or destroying it means that the next call of a
handler method may fail, causing the channel command
invoking the handler to fail as well. Depending on the
subcommand being invoked, the error message may not be able
to explain the reason for that failure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Every channel
created with this subcommand knows which interpreter it was
created in, and only ever executes its handler command in
that interpreter, even if the channel was shared with and/or
was moved into a different interpreter. Each reflected
channel also knows the thread it was created in, and
executes its handler command only in that thread, even if
the channel was moved into a different thread. To this end
all invocations of the handler are forwarded to the original
thread by posting special events to it. This means that the
original thread (i.e. the thread that executed the <b>chan
create</b> command) must have an active event loop, i.e. it
must be able to process such events. Otherwise the thread
sending them will <i>block indefinitely</i>. Deadlock may
occur.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
permits the creation of a channel whose two endpoints live
in two different threads, providing a stream-oriented bridge
between these threads. In other words, we can provide a way
for regular stream communication between threads instead of
having to send commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When a thread
or interpreter is deleted, all channels created with this
subcommand and using this thread/interpreter as their
computing base are deleted as well, in all interpreters they
have been shared with or moved into, and in whatever thread
they have been transfered to. While this pulls the rug out
under the other thread(s) and/or interpreter(s), this cannot
be avoided. Trying to use such a channel will cause the
generation of a regular error about unknown channel
handles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This subcommand
is <b>safe</b> and made accessible to safe interpreters.
While it arranges for the execution of arbitrary Tcl code
the system also makes sure that the code is always executed
within the safe interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan eof</b>
<i>channelId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Test whether the last input
operation on the channel called <i>channelId</i> failed
because the end of the data stream was reached, returning 1
if end-of-file was reached, and 0 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan event</b> <i>channelId
event</i> ?<i>script</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Arrange for the Tcl script
<i>script</i> to be installed as a <i>file event handler</i>
to be called whenever the channel called <i>channelId</i>
enters the state described by <i>event</i> (which must be
either <b>readable</b> or <b>writable</b>); only one such
handler may be installed per event per channel at a time. If
<i>script</i> is the empty string, the current handler is
deleted (this also happens if the channel is closed or the
interpreter deleted). If <i>script</i> is omitted, the
currently installed script is returned (or an empty string
if no such handler is installed). The callback is only
performed if the event loop is being serviced (e.g. via
<b>vwait</b> or <b>update</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A file event
handler is a binding between a channel and a script, such
that the script is evaluated whenever the channel becomes
readable or writable. File event handlers are most commonly
used to allow data to be received from another process on an
event-driven basis, so that the receiver can continue to
interact with the user or with other channels while waiting
for the data to arrive. If an application invokes <b>chan
gets</b> or <b>chan read</b> on a blocking channel when
there is no input data available, the process will block;
until the input data arrives, it will not be able to service
other events, so it will appear to the user to &ldquo;freeze
up&rdquo;. With <b>chan event</b>, the process can tell when
data is present and only invoke <b>chan gets</b> or <b>chan
read</b> when they will not block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A channel is
considered to be readable if there is unread data available
on the underlying device. A channel is also considered to be
readable if there is unread data in an input buffer, except
in the special case where the most recent attempt to read
from the channel was a <b>chan gets</b> call that could not
find a complete line in the input buffer. This feature
allows a file to be read a line at a time in nonblocking
mode using events. A channel is also considered to be
readable if an end of file or error condition is present on
the underlying file or device. It is important for
<i>script</i> to check for these conditions and handle them
appropriately; for example, if there is no special check for
end of file, an infinite loop may occur where <i>script</i>
reads no data, returns, and is immediately invoked
again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A channel is
considered to be writable if at least one byte of data can
be written to the underlying file or device without
blocking, or if an error condition is present on the
underlying file or device. Note that client sockets opened
in asynchronous mode become writable when they become
connected or if the connection fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Event-driven
I/O works best for channels that have been placed into
nonblocking mode with the <b>chan configure</b> command. In
blocking mode, a <b>chan puts</b> command may block if you
give it more data than the underlying file or device can
accept, and a <b>chan gets</b> or <b>chan read</b> command
will block if you attempt to read more data than is ready;
no events will be processed while the commands block. In
nonblocking mode <b>chan puts</b>, <b>chan read</b>, and
<b>chan gets</b> never block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The script for
a file event is executed at global level (outside the
context of any Tcl procedure) in the interpreter in which
the <b>chan event</b> command was invoked. If an error
occurs while executing the script then the command
registered with <b>interp bgerror</b> is used to report the
error. In addition, the file event handler is deleted if it
ever returns an error; this is done in order to prevent
infinite loops due to buggy handlers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan flush</b>
<i>channelId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Ensures that all pending output
for the channel called <i>channelId</i> is written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the channel
is in blocking mode the command does not return until all
the buffered output has been flushed to the channel. If the
channel is in nonblocking mode, the command may return
before all buffered output has been flushed; the remainder
will be flushed in the background as fast as the underlying
file or device is able to absorb it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan gets</b>
<i>channelId</i> ?<i>varName</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Reads the next line from the
channel called <i>channelId</i>. If <i>varName</i> is not
specified, the result of the command will be the line that
has been read (without a trailing newline character) or an
empty string upon end-of-file or, in non-blocking mode, if
the data available is exhausted. If <i>varName</i> is
specified, the line that has been read will be written to
the variable called <i>varName</i> and result will be the
number of characters that have been read or -1 if
end-of-file was reached or, in non-blocking mode, if the
data available is exhausted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If an
end-of-file occurs while part way through reading a line,
the partial line will be returned (or written into
<i>varName</i>). When <i>varName</i> is not specified, the
end-of-file case can be distinguished from an empty line
using the <b>chan eof</b> command, and the
partial-line-but-nonblocking case can be distinguished with
the <b>chan blocked</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan names</b>
?<i>pattern</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Produces a list of all channel
names. If <i>pattern</i> is specified, only those channel
names that match it (according to the rules of <b>string
match</b>) will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan pending</b> <i>mode
channelId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Depending on whether
<i>mode</i> is <b>input</b> or <b>output</b>, returns the
number of bytes of input or output (respectively) currently
buffered internally for <i>channelId</i> (especially useful
in a readable event callback to impose application-specific
limits on input line lengths to avoid a potential
denial-of-service attack where a hostile user crafts an
extremely long line that exceeds the available memory to
buffer it). Returns -1 if the channel was not opened for the
mode in question.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan postevent</b>
<i>channelId eventSpec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This subcommand is used by
command handlers specified with <b>chan create</b>. It
notifies the channel represented by the handle
<i>channelId</i> that the event(s) listed in the
<i>eventSpec</i> have occurred. The argument has to be a
list containing any of the strings <b>read</b> and
<b>write</b>. The list must contain at least one element as
it does not make sense to invoke the command if there are no
events to post.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
subcommand can only be used with channel handles that were
created/opened by <b>chan create</b>. All other channels
will cause this subcommand to report an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">As only the Tcl
level of a channel, i.e. its command handler, should post
events to it we also restrict the usage of this command to
the interpreter that created the channel. In other words,
posting events to a reflected channel from an interpreter
that does not contain it&rsquo;s implementation is not
allowed. Attempting to post an event from any other
interpreter will cause this subcommand to report an
error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Another
restriction is that it is not possible to post events that
the I/O core has not registered an interest in. Trying to do
so will cause the method to throw an error. See the command
handler method <b>watch</b> described in
<b>reflectedchan</b>, the document specifying the API of
command handlers for reflected channels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This command is
<b>safe</b> and made accessible to safe interpreters. It can
trigger the execution of <b>chan event</b> handlers, whether
in the current interpreter or in other interpreters or other
threads, even where the event is posted from a safe
interpreter and listened for by a trusted interpreter.
<b>Chan event</b> handlers are <i>always</i> executed in the
interpreter that set them up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan puts</b>
?<b>&minus;nonewline</b>? ?<i>channelId</i>?
<i>string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Writes <i>string</i> to the
channel named <i>channelId</i> followed by a newline
character. A trailing newline character is written unless
the optional flag <b>&minus;nonewline</b> is given. If
<i>channelId</i> is omitted, the string is written to the
standard output channel, <b>stdout</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Newline
characters in the output are translated by <b>chan puts</b>
to platform-specific end-of-line sequences according to the
currently configured value of the <b>&minus;translation</b>
option for the channel (for example, on PCs newlines are
normally replaced with carriage-return-linefeed sequences;
see <b>chan configure</b> above for details).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Tcl buffers
output internally, so characters written with <b>chan
puts</b> may not appear immediately on the output file or
device; Tcl will normally delay output until the buffer is
full or the channel is closed. You can force output to
appear immediately with the <b>chan flush</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When the output
buffer fills up, the <b>chan puts</b> command will normally
block until all the buffered data has been accepted for
output by the operating system. If <i>channelId</i> is in
nonblocking mode then the <b>chan puts</b> command will not
block even if the operating system cannot accept the data.
Instead, Tcl continues to buffer the data and writes it in
the background as fast as the underlying file or device can
accept it. The application must use the Tcl event loop for
nonblocking output to work; otherwise Tcl never finds out
that the file or device is ready for more output data. It is
possible for an arbitrarily large amount of data to be
buffered for a channel in nonblocking mode, which could
consume a large amount of memory. To avoid wasting memory,
nonblocking I/O should normally be used in an event-driven
fashion with the <b>chan event</b> command (do not invoke
<b>chan puts</b> unless you have recently been notified via
a file event that the channel is ready for more output
data).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan read</b>
<i>channelId</i> ?<i>numChars</i>? <b><br>
chan read</b> ?<b>&minus;nonewline</b>? <i>channelId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">In the first form, the result
will be the next <i>numChars</i> characters read from the
channel named <i>channelId</i>; if <i>numChars</i> is
omitted, all characters up to the point when the channel
would signal a failure (whether an end-of-file, blocked or
other error condition) are read. In the second form (i.e.
when <i>numChars</i> has been omitted) the flag
<b>&minus;nonewline</b> may be given to indicate that any
trailing newline in the string that has been read should be
trimmed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>channelId</i> is in nonblocking mode, <b>chan read</b>
may not read as many characters as requested: once all
available input has been read, the command will return the
data that is available rather than blocking for more input.
If the channel is configured to use a multi-byte encoding,
then there may actually be some bytes remaining in the
internal buffers that do not form a complete character.
These bytes will not be returned until a complete character
is available or end-of-file is reached. The
<b>&minus;nonewline</b> switch is ignored if the command
returns before reaching the end of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Chan
read</b> translates end-of-line sequences in the input into
newline characters according to the
<b>&minus;translation</b> option for the channel (see
<b>chan configure</b> above for a discussion on the ways in
which <b>chan configure</b> will alter input).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When reading
from a serial port, most applications should configure the
serial port channel to be nonblocking, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><b>chan configure</b>
<i>channelId</i> <b>&minus;blocking</b> <i>0</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Then <b>chan read</b> behaves
much like described above. Note that most serial ports are
comparatively slow; it is entirely possible to get a
<b>readable</b> event for each character read from them.
Care must be taken when using <b>chan read</b> on blocking
serial ports: <b><br>
chan read</b> <i>channelId numChars</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">In this form <b>chan read</b>
blocks until <i>numChars</i> have been received from the
serial port.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>chan read</b>
<i>channelId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">In this form <b>chan read</b>
blocks until the reception of the end-of-file character, see
<b>chan configure -eofchar</b>. If there no end-of-file
character has been configured for the channel, then <b>chan
read</b> will block forever.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan seek</b> <i>channelId
offset</i> ?<i>origin</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the current access
position within the underlying data stream for the channel
named <i>channelId</i> to be <i>offset</i> bytes relative to
<i>origin</i>. <i>Offset</i> must be an integer (which may
be negative) and <i>origin</i> must be one of the
following:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="10%">


<p><b>start</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="63%">


<p>The new access position will be <i>offset</i> bytes from
the start of the underlying file or device.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="10%">


<p><b>current</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="63%">


<p>The new access position will be <i>offset</i> bytes from
the current access position; a negative <i>offset</i> moves
the access position backwards in the underlying file or
device.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="10%">


<p><b>end</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="63%">


<p>The new access position will be <i>offset</i> bytes from
the end of the file or device. A negative <i>offset</i>
places the access position before the end of file, and a
positive <i>offset</i> places the access position after the
end of file.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>origin</i> argument defaults to <b>start</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Chan
seek</b> flushes all buffered output for the channel before
the command returns, even if the channel is in nonblocking
mode. It also discards any buffered and unread input. This
command returns an empty string. An error occurs if this
command is applied to channels whose underlying file or
device does not support seeking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<i>offset</i> values are byte offsets, not character
offsets. Both <b>chan seek</b> and <b>chan tell</b> operate
in terms of bytes, not characters, unlike <b>chan
read</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan tell</b>
<i>channelId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns a number giving the
current access position within the underlying data stream
for the channel named <i>channelId</i>. This value returned
is a byte offset that can be passed to <b>chan seek</b> in
order to set the channel to a particular position. Note that
this value is in terms of bytes, not characters like <b>chan
read</b>. The value returned is -1 for channels that do not
support seeking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chan truncate</b>
<i>channelId</i> ?<i>length</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the byte length of the
underlying data stream for the channel named
<i>channelId</i> to be <i>length</i> (or to the current byte
offset within the underlying data stream if <i>length</i> is
omitted). The channel is flushed before truncation.</p>
