<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tclsh &minus;
Simple shell containing Tcl interpreter</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tclsh</b>
?-encoding <i>name</i>? ?<i>fileName arg arg ...</i>?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tclsh</b> is
a shell-like application that reads Tcl commands from its
standard input or from a file and evaluates them. If invoked
with no arguments then it runs interactively, reading Tcl
commands from standard input and printing command results
and error messages to standard output. It runs until the
<b>exit</b> command is invoked or until it reaches
end-of-file on its standard input. If there exists a file
<b>.tclshrc</b> (or <b>tclshrc.tcl</b> on the Windows
platforms) in the home directory of the user, interactive
<b>tclsh</b> evaluates the file as a Tcl script just before
reading the first command from standard input.</p>

<h2>SCRIPT FILES
<a name="SCRIPT FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>tclsh</b>
is invoked with arguments then the first few arguments
specify <big>&#9474;</big> the name of a script file, and,
optionally, the encoding of the text <big>&#9474;</big> data
stored in that script file. Any additional arguments are
made available to the script as variables (see below).
Instead of reading commands from standard input <b>tclsh</b>
will read Tcl commands from the named file; <b>tclsh</b>
will exit when it reaches the end of the file. The end of
the file may be marked either by the physical end of the
medium, or by the character, &ldquo;\032&rdquo;
(&ldquo;\u001a&rdquo;, control-Z). If this character is
present in the file, the <b>tclsh</b> application will read
text up to but not including the character. An application
that requires this character in the file may safely encode
it as &ldquo;\032&rdquo;, &ldquo;\x1a&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;\u001a&rdquo;; or may generate it by use of commands
such as <b>format</b> or <b>binary</b>. There is no
automatic evaluation of <b>.tclshrc</b> when the name of a
script file is presented on the <b>tclsh</b> command line,
but the script file can always <b>source</b> it if
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you create a
Tcl script in a file whose first line is</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>#!/usr/local/bin/tclsh</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">then you can invoke the script
file directly from your shell if you mark the file as
executable. This assumes that <b>tclsh</b> has been
installed in the default location in /usr/local/bin; if it
is installed somewhere else then you will have to modify the
above line to match. Many UNIX systems do not allow the
<b>#!</b> line to exceed about 30 characters in length, so
be sure that the <b>tclsh</b> executable can be accessed
with a short file name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An even better
approach is to start your script files with the following
three lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>#!/bin/sh <br>
# the next line restarts using tclsh \ <br>
exec tclsh &quot;$0&quot; ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">This approach has three
advantages over the approach in the previous paragraph.
First, the location of the <b>tclsh</b> binary does not have
to be hard-wired into the script: it can be anywhere in your
shell search path. Second, it gets around the 30-character
file name limit in the previous approach. Third, this
approach will work even if <b>tclsh</b> is itself a shell
script (this is done on some systems in order to handle
multiple architectures or operating systems: the
<b>tclsh</b> script selects one of several binaries to run).
The three lines cause both <b>sh</b> and <b>tclsh</b> to
process the script, but the <b>exec</b> is only executed by
<b>sh</b>. <b>sh</b> processes the script first; it treats
the second line as a comment and executes the third line.
The <b>exec</b> statement cause the shell to stop processing
and instead to start up <b>tclsh</b> to reprocess the entire
script. When <b>tclsh</b> starts up, it treats all three
lines as comments, since the backslash at the end of the
second line causes the third line to be treated as part of
the comment on the second line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should note
that it is also common practice to install tclsh with its
version number as part of the name. This has the advantage
of allowing multiple versions of Tcl to exist on the same
system at once, but also the disadvantage of making it
harder to write scripts that start up uniformly across
different versions of Tcl.</p>

<h2>VARIABLES
<a name="VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tclsh</b>
sets the following Tcl variables:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>argc</b></p></td>
<td width="16%"></td>
<td width="66%">


<p>Contains a count of the number of <i>arg</i> arguments
(0 if none), not including the name of the script file.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>argv</b></p></td>
<td width="16%"></td>
<td width="66%">


<p>Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the <i>arg</i>
arguments, in order, or an empty string if there are no
<i>arg</i> arguments.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>argv0</b></p></td>
<td width="16%"></td>
<td width="66%">


<p>Contains <i>fileName</i> if it was specified. Otherwise,
contains the name by which <b>tclsh</b> was invoked.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_interactive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:34%;">Contains 1 if <b>tclsh</b> is
running interactively (no <i>fileName</i> was specified and
standard input is a terminal-like device), 0 otherwise.</p>

<h2>PROMPTS
<a name="PROMPTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>tclsh</b> is invoked interactively it normally prompts
for each command with &ldquo;<b>%</b> &rdquo;. You can
change the prompt by setting the variables
<b>tcl_prompt1</b> and <b>tcl_prompt2</b>. If variable
<b>tcl_prompt1</b> exists then it must consist of a Tcl
script to output a prompt; instead of outputting a prompt
<b>tclsh</b> will evaluate the script in <b>tcl_prompt1</b>.
The variable <b>tcl_prompt2</b> is used in a similar way
when a newline is typed but the current command is not yet
complete; if <b>tcl_prompt2</b> is not set then no prompt is
output for incomplete commands.</p>
