<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>zip</i> is a
compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS,
OS/2, Windows 9x/NT/XP, Minix, Atari, Macintosh, Amiga, and
Acorn RISC OS. It is analogous to a combination of the Unix
commands <i>tar</i>(1) and <i>compress</i>(1) and is
compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz&rsquo;s ZIP for MSDOS
systems).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A companion
program (<i>unzip</i>(1L)) unpacks <i>zip</i> archives. The
<i>zip</i> and <i>unzip</i>(1L) programs can work with
archives produced by PKZIP (supporting most PKZIP features
up to PKZIP version 4.6), and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can work
with archives produced by <i>zip</i> (with some exceptions,
notably streamed archives, but recent changes in the zip
file standard may facilitate better compatibility).
<i>zip</i> version 3.0 is compatible with PKZIP 2.04 and
also supports the Zip64 extensions of PKZIP 4.5 which allow
archives as well as files to exceed the previous 2 GB limit
(4 GB in some cases). <i>zip</i> also now supports
<b>bzip2</b> compression if the <b>bzip2</b> library is
included when <i>zip</i> is compiled. Note that PKUNZIP 1.10
cannot extract files produced by PKZIP 2.04 or
<i>zip&nbsp;3.0</i>. You must use PKUNZIP 2.04g or
<i>unzip&nbsp;5.0p1</i> (or later versions) to extract
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the
<b>EXAMPLES</b> section at the bottom of this page for
examples of some typical uses of <i>zip</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Large&nbsp;Archives&nbsp;and&nbsp;Zip64.</b>
<i>zip</i> automatically uses the Zip64 extensions when
files larger than 4 GB are added to an archive, an archive
containing Zip64 entries is updated (if the resulting
archive still needs Zip64), the size of the archive will
exceed 4 GB, or when the number of entries in the archive
will exceed about 64K. Zip64 is also used for archives
streamed from standard input as the size of such archives
are not known in advance, but the option
<b>&minus;fz&minus;</b> can be used to force <i>zip</i> to
create PKZIP 2 compatible archives (as long as Zip64
extensions are not needed). You must use a PKZIP 4.5
compatible unzip, such as <i>unzip&nbsp;6.0</i> or later, to
extract files using the Zip64 extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
streamed archives, entries encrypted with standard
encryption, or split archives created with the pause option
may not be compatible with PKZIP as data descriptors are
used and PKZIP at the time of this writing does not support
data descriptors (but recent changes in the PKWare published
zip standard now include some support for the data
descriptor format <i>zip</i> uses).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mac OS
X.</b> Though previous Mac versions had their own <i>zip</i>
port, <i>zip</i> supports Mac OS X as part of the Unix port
and most Unix features apply. References to
&quot;MacOS&quot; below generally refer to MacOS versions
older than OS X. Support for some Mac OS features in the
Unix Mac OS X port, such as resource forks, is expected in
the next <i>zip</i> release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a brief
help on <i>zip</i> and <i>unzip</i>, run each without
specifying any parameters on the command line.</p>

<h2>USE
<a name="USE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The program is
useful for packaging a set of files for distribution; for
archiving files; and for saving disk space by temporarily
compressing unused files or directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>zip</i>
program puts one or more compressed files into a single
<i>zip</i> archive, along with information about the files
(name, path, date, time of last modification, protection,
and check information to verify file integrity). An entire
directory structure can be packed into a <i>zip</i> archive
with a single command. Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are
common for text files. <i>zip</i> has one compression method
(deflation) and can also store files without compression.
(If <b>bzip2</b> support is added, <i>zip</i> can also
compress using <b>bzip2</b> compression, but such entries
require a reasonably modern unzip to decompress. When
<b>bzip2</b> compression is selected, it replaces deflation
as the default method.) <i>zip</i> automatically chooses the
better of the two (deflation or store or, if <b>bzip2</b> is
selected, <b>bzip2</b> or store) for each file to be
compressed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Command&nbsp;format.</b>
The basic command format is</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zip</b>
options archive inpath inpath ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<b>archive</b> is a new or existing <i>zip</i> archive and
<b>inpath</b> is a directory or file path optionally
including wildcards. When given the name of an existing
<i>zip</i> archive, <i>zip</i> will replace identically
named entries in the <i>zip</i> archive (matching the
relative names as stored in the archive) or add entries for
new names. For example, if <i>foo.zip</i> exists and
contains <i>foo/file1</i> and <i>foo/file2</i>, and the
directory <i>foo</i> contains the files <i>foo/file1</i> and
<i>foo/file3</i>, then:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip -r
foo.zip foo</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or more
concisely</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip -r foo
foo</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will replace
<i>foo/file1</i> in <i>foo.zip</i> and add <i>foo/file3</i>
to <i>foo.zip</i>. After this, <i>foo.zip</i> contains
<i>foo/file1</i>, <i>foo/file2</i>, and <i>foo/file3</i>,
with <i>foo/file2</i> unchanged from before.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So if before
the zip command is executed <i>foo.zip</i> has:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>foo/file1
foo/file2</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and directory
foo has:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>file1
file3</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">then
<i>foo.zip</i> will have:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>foo/file1
foo/file2 foo/file3</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<i>foo/file1</i> is replaced and <i>foo/file3</i> is
new.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;@&nbsp;file&nbsp;lists.</b>
If a file list is specified as <b>&minus;@</b> [Not on
MacOS], <i>zip</i> takes the list of input files from
standard input instead of from the command line. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip -@
foo</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will store the
files listed one per line on stdin in <i>foo.zip</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under Unix,
this option can be used to powerful effect in conjunction
with the <i>find&nbsp;</i>(1) command. For example, to
archive all the C source files in the current directory and
its subdirectories:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>find .
-name &quot;*.[ch]&quot; -print | zip source -@</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(note that the
pattern must be quoted to keep the shell from expanding
it).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Streaming&nbsp;input&nbsp;and&nbsp;output.</b>
<i>zip</i> will also accept a single dash (&quot;-&quot;) as
the zip file name, in which case it will write the zip file
to standard output, allowing the output to be piped to
another program. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip -r - .
| dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would write the
zip output directly to a tape with the specified block size
for the purpose of backing up the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>zip</i> also
accepts a single dash (&quot;-&quot;) as the name of a file
to be compressed, in which case it will read the file from
standard input, allowing zip to take input from another
program. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>tar cf - .
| zip backup -</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would compress
the output of the tar command for the purpose of backing up
the current directory. This generally produces better
compression than the previous example using the -r option
because <i>zip</i> can take advantage of redundancy between
files. The backup can be restored using the command</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>unzip -p
backup | tar xf -</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When no zip
file name is given and stdout is not a terminal, <i>zip</i>
acts as a filter, compressing standard input to standard
output. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>tar cf - .
| zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is equivalent
to</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>tar cf - .
| zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>zip</i>
archives created in this manner can be extracted with the
program <i>funzip</i> which is provided in the <i>unzip</i>
package, or by <i>gunzip</i> which is provided in the
<i>gzip</i> package (but some <i>gunzip</i> may not support
this if <i>zip</i> used the Zip64 extensions). For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">dd
if=/dev/nrst0 ibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The stream can
also be saved to a file and <i>unzip</i> used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If Zip64
support for large files and archives is enabled and
<i>zip</i> is used as a filter, <i>zip</i> creates a Zip64
archive that requires a PKZIP 4.5 or later compatible unzip
to read it. This is to avoid amgibuities in the zip file
structure as defined in the current zip standard (PKWARE
AppNote) where the decision to use Zip64 needs to be made
before data is written for the entry, but for a stream the
size of the data is not known at that point. If the data is
known to be smaller than 4 GB, the option
<b>&minus;fz&minus;</b> can be used to prevent use of Zip64,
but <i>zip</i> will exit with an error if Zip64 was in fact
needed. <i>zip&nbsp;3</i> and <i>unzip&nbsp;6</i> and later
can read archives with Zip64 entries. Also, <i>zip</i>
removes the Zip64 extensions if not needed when archive
entries are copied (see the <b>&minus;U</b>
(<b>&minus;&minus;copy</b>) option).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When directing
the output to another file, note that all options should be
before the redirection including <b>-x</b>. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">zip archive
&quot;*.h&quot; &quot;*.c&quot; -x donotinclude.h orthis.h
&gt; tofile</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Zip&nbsp;files.</b>
When changing an existing <i>zip</i> archive, <i>zip</i>
will write a temporary file with the new contents, and only
replace the old one when the process of creating the new
version has been completed without error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the name of
the <i>zip</i> archive does not contain an extension, the
extension <b>.zip</b> is added. If the name already contains
an extension other than <b>.zip</b>, the existing extension
is kept unchanged. However, split archives (archives split
over multiple files) require the <b>.zip</b> extension on
the last split.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Scanning&nbsp;and&nbsp;reading&nbsp;files.</b>
When <i>zip</i> starts, it scans for files to process (if
needed). If this scan takes longer than about 5 seconds,
<i>zip</i> will display a &quot;Scanning files&quot; message
and start displaying progress dots every 2 seconds or every
so many entries processed, whichever takes longer. If there
is more than 2 seconds between dots it could indicate that
finding each file is taking time and could mean a slow
network connection for example. (Actually the initial file
scan is a two-step process where the directory scan is
followed by a sort and these two steps are separated with a
space in the dots. If updating an existing archive, a space
also appears between the existing file scan and the new file
scan.) The scanning files dots are not controlled by the
<b>&minus;ds</b> dot size option, but the dots are turned
off by the <b>&minus;q</b> quiet option. The
<b>&minus;sf</b> show files option can be used to scan for
files and get the list of files scanned without actually
processing them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>zip</i>
is not able to read a file, it issues a warning but
continues. See the <b>&minus;MM</b> option below for more on
how <i>zip</i> handles patterns that are not matched and
files that are not readable. If some files were skipped, a
warning is issued at the end of the zip operation noting how
many files were read and how many skipped.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Command&nbsp;modes.</b>
<i>zip</i> now supports two distinct types of command modes,
<b>external</b> and <b>internal</b>. The <b>external</b>
modes (add, update, and freshen) read files from the file
system (as well as from an existing archive) while the
<b>internal</b> modes (delete and copy) operate exclusively
on entries in an existing archive. <b><br>
add&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Update existing entries and add
new files. If the archive does not exist create it. This is
the default mode.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>update&nbsp;</b>(<b>&minus;u</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Update existing entries if
newer on the file system and add new files. If the archive
does not exist issue warning then create a new archive.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>freshen&nbsp;</b>(<b>&minus;f</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Update existing entries of an
archive if newer on the file system. Does not add new files
to the archive.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>delete&nbsp;</b>(<b>&minus;d</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select entries in an existing
archive and delete them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>copy&nbsp;</b>(<b>&minus;U</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select entries in an existing
archive and copy them to a new archive. This new mode is
similar to <b>update</b> but command line patterns select
entries in the existing archive rather than files from the
file system and it uses the <b>&minus;&minus;out</b> option
to write the resulting archive to a new file rather than
update the existing archive, leaving the original archive
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The new File
Sync option (<b>&minus;FS</b>) is also considered a new
mode, though it is similar to <b>update</b>. This mode
synchronizes the archive with the files on the OS, only
replacing files in the archive if the file time or size of
the OS file is different, adding new files, and deleting
entries from the archive where there is no matching file. As
this mode can delete entries from the archive, consider
making a backup copy of the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also see
<b>&minus;DF</b> for creating difference archives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See each option
description below for details and the <b>EXAMPLES</b>
section below for examples.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Split&nbsp;archives.</b>
<i>zip</i> version 3.0 and later can create split archives.
A <b>split archive</b> is a standard zip archive split over
multiple files. (Note that split archives are not just
archives split in to pieces, as the offsets of entries are
now based on the start of each split. Concatenating the
pieces together will invalidate these offsets, but
<i>unzip</i> can usually deal with it. <i>zip</i> will
usually refuse to process such a spliced archive unless the
<b>&minus;FF</b> fix option is used to fix the offsets.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One use of
split archives is storing a large archive on multiple
removable media. For a split archive with 20 split files the
files are typically named (replace ARCHIVE with the name of
your archive) ARCHIVE.z01, ARCHIVE.z02, ..., ARCHIVE.z19,
ARCHIVE.zip. Note that the last file is the <b>.zip</b>
file. In contrast, <b>spanned archives</b> are the original
multi-disk archive generally requiring floppy disks and
using volume labels to store disk numbers. <i>zip</i>
supports split archives but not spanned archives, though a
procedure exists for converting split archives of the right
size to spanned archives. The reverse is also true, where
each file of a spanned archive can be copied in order to
files with the above names to create a split archive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use
<b>&minus;s</b> to set the split size and create a split
archive. The size is given as a number followed optionally
by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB) (the default is
m). The <b>&minus;sp</b> option can be used to pause
<i>zip</i> between splits to allow changing removable media,
for example, but read the descriptions and warnings for both
<b>&minus;s</b> and <b>&minus;sp</b> below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Though
<i>zip</i> does not update split archives, <i>zip</i>
provides the new option <b>&minus;O</b>
(<b>&minus;&minus;output&minus;file</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;out</b>) to allow split archives to be
updated and saved in a new archive. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip
inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c &minus;&minus;out
outarchive.zip</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">reads archive
<b>inarchive.zip</b>, even if split, adds the files
<b>foo.c</b> and <b>bar.c</b>, and writes the resulting
archive to <b>outarchive.zip</b>. If <b>inarchive.zip</b> is
split then <b>outarchive.zip</b> defaults to the same split
size. Be aware that if <b>outarchive.zip</b> and any split
files that are created with it already exist, these are
always overwritten as needed without warning. This may be
changed in the future.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unicode.</b>
Though the zip standard requires storing paths in an archive
using a specific character set, in practice zips have stored
paths in archives in whatever the local character set is.
This creates problems when an archive is created or updated
on a system using one character set and then extracted on
another system using a different character set. When
compiled with Unicode support enabled on platforms that
support wide characters, <i>zip</i> now stores, in addition
to the standard local path for backward compatibility, the
UTF-8 translation of the path. This provides a common
universal character set for storing paths that allows these
paths to be fully extracted on other systems that support
Unicode and to match as close as possible on systems that
don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On Win32
systems where paths are internally stored as Unicode but
represented in the local character set, it&rsquo;s possible
that some paths will be skipped during a local character set
directory scan. <i>zip</i> with Unicode support now can read
and store these paths. Note that Win 9x systems and FAT file
systems don&rsquo;t fully support Unicode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be aware that
console windows on Win32 and Unix, for example, sometimes
don&rsquo;t accurately show all characters due to how each
operating system switches in character sets for display.
However, directory navigation tools should show the correct
paths if the needed fonts are loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Command line
format.</b> This version of <i>zip</i> has updated command
line processing and support for long options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Short options
take the form</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>-s[-][s[-]...][value][=value][&nbsp;value]</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where s is a
one or two character short option. A short option that takes
a value is last in an argument and anything after it is
taken as the value. If the option can be negated and
&quot;-&quot; immediately follows the option, the option is
negated. Short options can also be given as separate
arguments</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>-s[-][value][=value][&nbsp;value]&nbsp;-s[-][value][=value][&nbsp;value]&nbsp;...</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Short options
in general take values either as part of the same argument
or as the following argument. An optional = is also
supported. So</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>-ttmmddyyyy</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>-tt=mmddyyyy</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>-tt
mmddyyyy</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">all work. The
<b>&minus;x</b> and <b>&minus;i</b> options accept lists of
values and use a slightly different format described below.
See the <b>&minus;x</b> and <b>&minus;i</b> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Long options
take the form</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>--longoption[-][=value][
value]</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where the
option starts with --, has a multicharacter name, can
include a trailing dash to negate the option (if the option
supports it), and can have a value (option argument)
specified by preceeding it with = (no spaces). Values can
also follow the argument. So</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>--before-date=mmddyyyy</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>--before-date
mmddyyyy</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">both work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Long option
names can be shortened to the shortest unique abbreviation.
See the option descriptions below for which support long
options. To avoid confusion, avoid abbreviating a negatable
option with an embedded dash (&quot;-&quot;) at the dash if
you plan to negate it (the parser would consider a trailing
dash, such as for the option
<b>&minus;&minus;some&minus;option</b> using
<b>&minus;&minus;some&minus;</b> as the option, as part of
the name rather than a negating dash). This may be changed
to force the last dash in <b>&minus;&minus;some&minus;</b>
to be negating in the future.</p>

possible the archive came from a system where case does
matter and the archive could include both <b>Bar</b> and

archive are missing, but requires a reasonably intact
central directory. The input archive is scanned as usual,
but <i>zip</i> will ignore some problems. The resulting
archive should be valid, but any inconsistent entries will
be left out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When doubled as
in <b>&minus;FF</b>, the archive is scanned from the
beginning and <i>zip</i> scans for special signatures to
identify the limits between the archive members. The single
<b>&minus;F</b> is more reliable if the archive is not too
much damaged, so try this option first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the archive
is too damaged or the end has been truncated, you must use
<b>&minus;FF</b>. This is a change from
<i>zip&nbsp;2.32</i>, where the <b>&minus;F</b> option is
able to read a truncated archive. The <b>&minus;F</b> option
now more reliably fixes archives with minor damage and the
<b>&minus;FF</b> option is needed to fix archives where
<b>&minus;F</b> might have been sufficient before.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Neither option
will recover archives that have been incorrectly transferred
in ascii mode instead of binary. After the repair, the
<b>&minus;t</b> option of <i>unzip</i> may show that some
files have a bad CRC. Such files cannot be recovered; you
can remove them from the archive using the <b>&minus;d</b>
option of <i>zip</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>&minus;FF</b> may have trouble fixing archives that
include an embedded zip archive that was stored (without
compression) in the archive and, depending on the damage, it
may find the entries in the embedded archive rather than the
archive itself. Try <b>&minus;F</b> first as it does not
have this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the fix commands have changed. For example, to fix the
damaged archive <i>foo.zip</i>,</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">tries to read

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip -FF foo
--out foofixfix</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">and compare the
resulting archive to the archive created by <b>&minus;F</b>.
The <b>&minus;FF</b> option may create an inconsistent
archive. Depending on what is damaged, you can then use the
<b>&minus;F</b> option to fix that archive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A split archive
with missing split files can be fixed using <b>&minus;F</b>
if you have the last split of the archive (the <b>.zip</b>
file). If this file is missing, you must use
<b>&minus;FF</b> to fix the archive, which will prompt you
for the splits you have.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;filesync</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Synchronize the contents of an
archive with the files on the OS. Normally when an archive
is updated, new files are added and changed files are
updated but files that no longer exist on the OS are not
deleted from the archive. This option enables a new mode
that checks entries in the archive against the file system.
If the file time and file size of the entry matches that of
the OS file, the entry is copied from the old archive
instead of being read from the file system and compressed.
If the OS file has changed, the entry is read and compressed
as usual. If the entry in the archive does not match a file
on the OS, the entry is deleted. Enabling this option should
create archives that are the same as new archives, but since
existing entries are copied instead of compressed, updating
an existing archive with <b>&minus;FS</b> can be much faster
than creating a new archive. Also consider using
<b>&minus;u</b> for updating an archive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For this option
to work, the archive should be updated from the same
directory it was created in so the relative paths match. If
few files are being copied from the old archive, it may be
faster to create a new archive instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to
the local timezone in order for this option to work
correctly. A change in timezone since the original archive
was created could result in no times matching and
recompression of all files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option
deletes files from the archive. If you need to preserve the
original archive, make a copy of the archive first or use
the <b>&minus;&minus;out</b> option to output the updated
archive to a new file. Even though it may be slower,
creating a new archive with a new archive name is safer,
avoids mismatches between archive and OS paths, and is
preferred.</p>

readable. Normally when an input pattern does not match a
file the &quot;name not matched&quot; warning is issued and
when an input file has been found but later is missing or
not readable a missing or not readable warning is issued. In
either case <i>zip</i> continues creating the archive, with
missing or unreadable new files being skipped and files
already in the archive remaining unchanged. After the
archive is created, if any files were not readable
<i>zip</i> returns the OPEN error code (18 on most systems)
instead of the normal success return (0 on most systems).
With <b>&minus;MM</b> set, <i>zip</i> exits as soon as an
input pattern is not matched (whenever the &quot;name not

is not readable. In either case <i>zip</i> exits with an
OPEN error and no archive is created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
useful when a known list of files is to be zipped so any
missing or unreadable files will result in an error. It is
less useful when used with wildcards, but <i>zip</i> will
still exit with an error if any input pattern doesn&rsquo;t
match at least one file and if any matched files are
unreadable. If you want to create the archive anyway and

store any files that end in <i>.Z</i>, <i>.zip</i>,
<i>.tiff</i>, <i>.gif</i>, or <i>.snd</i> without trying to
compress them (image and sound files often have their own
specialized compression methods). By default, <i>zip</i>
does not compress files with extensions in the list
<i>.Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj.</i> Such files are stored
directly in the output archive. The environment variable
ZIPOPT can be used to change the default options. For
example under Unix with csh:</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">setenv ZIPOPT
&quot;-n .gif:.zip&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">To attempt

compression option <b>&minus;9</b> also attempts compression
on all files regardless of extension.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On Acorn RISC

all the files and directories in <b>foo</b> are saved in a

with names starting with <b>&quot;.&quot;</b>, since the
recursion does not use the shell&rsquo;s file-name

the pattern of files to be included. You should not use

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In this case,
all the files matching <b>*.c</b> in the tree starting at

option enables [] matching again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s&nbsp;</b>splitsize
<b><br>
&minus;&minus;split&minus;size&nbsp;</b>splitsize</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable creating a split archive
and set the split size. A split archive is an archive that
could be split over many files. As the archive is created,
if the size of the archive reaches the specified split size,
that split is closed and the next split opened. In general
all splits but the last will be the split size and the last
will be whatever is left. If the entire archive is smaller
than the split size a single-file archive is created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Split archives
are stored in numbered files. For example, if the output
archive is named <b>archive</b> and three splits are
required, the resulting archive will be in the three files
<b>archive.z01</b>, <b>archive.z02</b>, and
<b>archive.zip</b>. Do not change the numbering of these
files or the archive will not be readable as these are used
to determine the order the splits are read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Split size is a
number optionally followed by a multiplier. Currently the
number must be an integer. The multiplier can currently be
one of <b>k</b> (kilobytes), <b>m</b> (megabytes), <b>g</b>
(gigabytes), or <b>t</b> (terabytes). As 64k is the minimum
split size, numbers without multipliers default to
megabytes. For example, to create a split archive called
<b>foo</b> with the contents of the <b>bar</b> directory
with splits of 670 MB that might be useful for burning on
CDs, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">zip -s 670m -r
foo bar</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">could be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Currently the
old splits of a split archive are not excluded from a new
archive, but they can be specifically excluded. If possible,
keep the input and output archives out of the path being
zipped when creating split archives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Using
<b>&minus;s</b> without <b>&minus;sp</b> as above creates
all the splits where <b>foo</b> is being written, in this
case the current directory. This split mode updates the
splits as the archive is being created, requiring all splits
to remain writable, but creates split archives that are
readable by any unzip that supports split archives. See
<b>&minus;sp</b> below for enabling split pause mode which
allows splits to be written directly to removable media.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The option
<b>&minus;sv</b> can be used to enable verbose splitting and
provide details of how the splitting is being done. The
<b>&minus;sb</b> option can be used to ring the bell when
<i>zip</i> pauses for the next split destination.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Split archives
cannot be updated, but see the <b>&minus;O</b>

can be updated as it is copied to a new archive. A split

*</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">creates the
archive <i>stuff.zip</i> (assuming it does not exist) and
puts all the files in the current directory in it, in
compressed form (the <b>.zip</b> suffix is added
automatically, unless the archive name contains a dot
already; this allows the explicit specification of other
suffixes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because of the
way the shell on Unix does filename substitution, files
starting with &quot;.&quot; are not included; to include
these as well:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip stuff
.* *</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Even this will
not include any subdirectories from the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To zip up an
entire directory, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip -r foo
foo</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">creates the
archive <i>foo.zip</i>, containing all the files and
directories in the directory <i>foo</i> that is contained
within the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may want to
make a <i>zip</i> archive that contains the files in
<i>foo</i>, without recording the directory name,
<i>foo</i>. You can use the <b>&minus;j</b> option to leave
off the paths, as in:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip -j foo
foo/*</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
short on disk space, you might not have enough room to hold
both the original directory and the corresponding compressed
<i>zip</i> archive. In this case, you can create the archive
in steps using the <b>&minus;m</b> option. If <i>foo</i>
contains the subdirectories <i>tom</i>, <i>dick</i>, and
<i>harry</i>, you can:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip -rm foo
foo/tom <br>
zip -rm foo foo/dick <br>
zip -rm foo foo/harry</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where the first
command creates <i>foo.zip</i>, and the next two add to it.
At the completion of each <i>zip</i> command, the last
created archive is deleted, making room for the next
<i>zip</i> command to function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use
<b>&minus;s</b> to set the split size and create a split
archive. The size is given as a number followed optionally
by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB). The command</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip -s 2g
-r split.zip foo</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">creates a split
archive of the directory foo with splits no bigger than
2&nbsp;GB each. If foo contained 5&nbsp;GB of contents and
the contents were stored in the split archive without
compression (to make this example simple), this would create
three splits, split.z01 at 2&nbsp;GB, split.z02 at
2&nbsp;GB, and split.zip at a little over 1&nbsp;GB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;sp</b> option can be used to pause <i>zip</i>
between splits to allow changing removable media, for
example, but read the descriptions and warnings for both
<b>&minus;s</b> and <b>&minus;sp</b> below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Though
<i>zip</i> does not update split archives, <i>zip</i>
provides the new option <b>&minus;O</b>
(<b>&minus;&minus;output&minus;file</b>) to allow split
archives to be updated and saved in a new archive. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip
inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c &minus;&minus;out
outarchive.zip</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">reads archive
<b>inarchive.zip</b>, even if split, adds the files
<b>foo.c</b> and <b>bar.c</b>, and writes the resulting

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Unix shells

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">would add to

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Negation is
also supported, where any character in that position not in
the list matches. Negation is supported by adding <b>!</b>
or <b>^</b> to the beginning of the list:</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>zip archive
&quot;*.[!o]&quot;</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">matches files
that don&rsquo;t end in &quot;.o&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On WIN32, []
matching needs to be turned on with the -RE option to avoid
the confusion that names with [ or ] have caused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When these
characters are encountered (without being escaped with a
backslash or quotes), the shell will look for files relative
to the current path that match the pattern, and replace the
argument with a list of the names that matched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>zip</i>
program can do the same matching on names that are in the
<i>zip</i> archive being modified or, in the case of the
<b>&minus;x</b> (exclude) or <b>&minus;i</b> (include)
options, on the list of files to be operated on, by using
backslashes or quotes to tell the shell not to do the name
expansion. In general, when <i>zip</i> encounters a name in
the list of files to do, it first looks for the name in the
file system. If it finds it, it then adds it to the list of
files to do. If it does not find it, it looks for the name
in the <i>zip</i> archive being modified (if it exists),
using the pattern matching characters described above, if
present. For each match, it will add that name to the list
of files to be processed, unless this name matches one given
with the <b>&minus;x</b> option, or does not match any name
given with the <b>&minus;i</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pattern
matching includes the path, and so patterns like \*.o match
names that end in &quot;.o&quot;, no matter what the path
prefix is. Note that the backslash must precede every
special character (i.e. ?*[]), or the entire argument must
be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general, use
backslashes or double quotes for paths that have wildcards
to make <i>zip</i> do the pattern matching for file paths,
and always for paths and strings that have spaces or
wildcards for <b>&minus;i</b>, <b>&minus;x</b>,

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">VMS interprets
standard Unix (or PC) return values as other,
scarier-looking things, so <i>zip</i> instead maps them into
VMS-style status codes. In general, <i>zip</i> sets VMS
Facility = 1955 (0x07A3), Code = 2* Unix_status, and an
appropriate Severity (as specified in ziperr.h). More
details are included in the VMS-specific documentation. See
[.vms]NOTES.TXT and [.vms]vms_msg_gen.c.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>zip</i> 3.0
is not compatible with PKUNZIP 1.10. Use <i>zip</i> 1.1 to
produce <i>zip</i> files which can be extracted by PKUNZIP
1.10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>zip</i>
files produced by <i>zip</i> 3.0 must not be <i>updated</i>
by <i>zip</i> 1.1 or PKZIP 1.10, if they contain encrypted
members or if they have been produced in a pipe or on a
non-seekable device. The old versions of <i>zip</i> or PKZIP
would create an archive with an incorrect format. The old
versions can list the contents of the zip file but cannot
extract it anyway (because of the new compression
algorithm). If you do not use encryption and use regular
disk files, you do not have to care about this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under VMS, not
all of the odd file formats are treated properly. Only
stream-LF format <i>zip</i> files are expected to work with
<i>zip</i>. Others can be converted using Rahul
Dhesi&rsquo;s BILF program. This version of <i>zip</i>
handles some of the conversion internally. When using Kermit
to transfer zip files from VMS to MSDOS, type &quot;set file
type block&quot; on VMS. When transfering from MSDOS to VMS,
type &quot;set file type fixed&quot; on VMS. In both cases,
type &quot;set file type binary&quot; on MSDOS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under some
older VMS versions, <i>zip</i> may hang for file
specifications that use DECnet syntax <i>foo::*.*.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On OS/2, zip
cannot match some names, such as those including an
exclamation mark or a hash sign. This is a bug in OS/2
itself: the 32-bit DosFindFirst/Next don&rsquo;t find such
names. Other programs such as GNU tar are also affected by
this bug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under OS/2, the
amount of Extended Attributes displayed by DIR is (for
compatibility) the amount returned by the 16-bit version of
DosQueryPathInfo(). Otherwise OS/2 1.3 and 2.0 would report
different EA sizes when DIRing a file. However, the
structure layout returned by the 32-bit DosQueryPathInfo()
is a bit different, it uses extra padding bytes and link
pointers (it&rsquo;s a linked list) to have all fields on
4-byte boundaries for portability to future RISC OS/2
versions. Therefore the value reported by <i>zip</i> (which
uses this 32-bit-mode size) differs from that reported by
DIR. <i>zip</i> stores the 32-bit format for portability,
even the 16-bit MS-C-compiled version running on OS/2 1.3,
so even this one shows the 32-bit-mode size.</p>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
<a name="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thanks to R. P.
Byrne for his <i>Shrink.Pas</i> program, which inspired this
project, and from which the shrink algorithm was stolen; to
Phil Katz for placing in the public domain the <i>zip</i>
file format, compression format, and .ZIP filename
extension, and for accepting minor changes to the file
format; to Steve Burg for clarifications on the deflate
format; to Haruhiko Okumura and Leonid Broukhis for
providing some useful ideas for the compression algorithm;
to Keith Petersen, Rich Wales, Hunter Goatley and Mark Adler
for providing a mailing list and <i>ftp</i> site for the
Info-ZIP group to use; and most importantly, to the Info-ZIP
group itself (listed in the file <i>infozip.who</i>) without
whose tireless testing and bug-fixing efforts a portable
<i>zip</i> would not have been possible. Finally we should
thank (blame) the first Info-ZIP moderator, David
Kirschbaum, for getting us into this mess in the first
place. The manual page was rewritten for Unix by R. P. C.
Rodgers and updated by E. Gordon for <i>zip</i> 3.0.</p>
