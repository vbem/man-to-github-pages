<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>audispd.conf</b>
is the file that controls the configuration of the audit
event dispatcher. Each line should contain one configuration
keyword, an equal sign, and then followed by appropriate
configuration information. All option names and values are
case insensitive. The keywords recognized are listed and
described below. Each line should be limited to 160
characters or the line will be skipped. You may add comments
to the file by starting the line with a &rsquo;#&rsquo;
character. <i><br>
q_depth</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a numeric value that
tells how big to make the internal queue of the audit event
dispatcher. A bigger queue lets it handle a flood of events
better, but could hold events that are not processed when
the daemon is terminated. If you get messages in syslog
about events getting dropped, increase this value. The
default value is 80.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>overflow_action</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option determines how the
daemon should react to overflowing its internal queue. When
this happens, it means that more events are being received
than it can get rid of. This error means that it is going to
lose the current event its trying to dispatch. It has the
following choices: <i>ignore</i>, <i>syslog</i>,
<i>suspend</i>, <i>single</i>, and <i>halt</i>. If set to
<i>ignore</i>, the audisp daemon does nothing. <i>syslog</i>
means that it will issue a warning to syslog. <i>suspend</i>
will cause the audisp daemon to stop processing events. The
daemon will still be alive. The <i>single</i> option will
cause the audisp daemon to put the computer system in single
user mode. <i>halt</i> option will cause the audisp daemon
to shutdown the computer system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>priority_boost</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a non-negative number
that tells the audit event dispatcher how much of a priority
boost it should take. This boost is in addition to the boost
provided from the audit daemon. The default is 4. No change
is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>max_restarts</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a non-negative number
that tells the audit event dispatcher how many times it can
try to restart a crashed plugin. The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>name_format</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option controls how
computer node names are inserted into the audit event
stream. It has the following choices: <i>none</i>,
<i>hostname</i>, <i>fqd</i>, <i>numeric</i>, and
<i>user</i>. <i>None</i> means that no computer name is
inserted into the audit event. <i>hostname</i> is the name
returned by the gethostname syscall. The <i>fqd</i> means
that it takes the hostname and resolves it with dns for a
fully qualified domain name of that machine. <i>Numeric</i>
is similar to fqd except it resolves the IP address of the
machine. <i>User</i> is an admin defined string from the
name option. The default value is <i>none</i>.</p>
