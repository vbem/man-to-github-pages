<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">auditd.conf
&minus; audit daemon configuration file</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file
<i>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</i> contains configuration
information specific to the audit daemon. Each line should
contain one configuration keyword, an equal sign, and then
followed by appropriate configuration information. All
option names and values are case insensitive. The keywords
recognized are listed and described below. Each line should
be limited to 160 characters or the line will be skipped.
You may add comments to the file by starting the line with a
&rsquo;#&rsquo; character. <i><br>
log_file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This keyword specifies the full
path name to the log file where audit records will be
stored. It must be a regular file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>log_format</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The log format describes how
the information should be stored on disk. There are 2
options: raw and nolog. If set to <i>RAW</i>, the audit
records will be stored in a format exactly as the kernel
sends it. If this option is set to <i>NOLOG</i> then all
audit information is discarded instead of writing to disk.
This mode does not affect data sent to the audit event
dispatcher.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>log_group</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This keyword specifies the
group that is applied to the log file&rsquo;s permissions.
The default is root. The group name can be either numeric or
spelled out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>priority_boost</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a non-negative number
that tells the audit daemon how much of a priority boost it
should take. The default is 4. No change is 0.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><i>flush</i></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Valid values are <i>none</i>, <i>incremental</i>,
<i>data</i>, and <i>sync</i>. If set to <i>none</i>, no
special effort is made to flush the audit records to disk.
If set to <i>incremental</i>, Then the <i>freq</i> parameter
is used to determine how often an explicit flush to disk is
issued. The <i>data</i> parameter tells the audit daemon to
keep the data portion of the disk file sync&rsquo;d at all
times. The <i>sync</i> option tells the audit daemon to keep
both the data and meta-data fully sync&rsquo;d with every
write to disk.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><i>freq</i></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This is a non-negative number that tells the audit
daemon how many records to write before issuing an explicit
flush to disk command. This value is only valid when the
<i>flush</i> keyword is set to <i>incremental</i>.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>num_logs</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This keyword specifies the
number of log files to keep if rotate is given as the
<i>max_log_file_action.</i> If the number is &lt; 2, logs
are not rotated. This number must be 99 or less. The default
is 0 - which means no rotation. As you increase the number
of log files being rotated, you may need to adjust the
kernel backlog setting upwards since it takes more time to
rotate the files. This is typically done in
/etc/audit/audit.rules. If log rotation is configured to
occur, the daemon will check for excess logs and remove them
in effort to keep disk space available. The excess log check
is only done on startup and when a reconfigure results in a
space check.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>disp_qos</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option controls whether
you want blocking/lossless or non-blocking/lossy
communication between the audit daemon and the dispatcher.
There is a 128k buffer between the audit daemon and
dispatcher. This is good enogh for most uses. If lossy is
chosen, incoming events going to the dispatcher are
discarded when this queue is full. (Events are still written
to disk if log_format is not nolog.) Otherwise the auditd
daemon will wait for the queue to have an empty spot before
logging to disk. The risk is that while the daemon is
waiting for network IO, an event is not being recorded to
disk. Valid values are: lossy and lossless. Lossy is the
default value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>dispatcher</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The dispatcher is a program
that is started by the audit daemon when it starts up. It
will pass a copy of all audit events to that
application&rsquo;s stdin. Make sure you trust the
application that you add to this line since it runs with
root privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>name_format</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option controls how
computer node names are inserted into the audit event
stream. It has the following choices: <i>none</i>,
<i>hostname</i>, <i>fqd</i>, <i>numeric</i>, and
<i>user</i>. <i>None</i> means that no computer name is
inserted into the audit event. <i>hostname</i> is the name
returned by the gethostname syscall. The <i>fqd</i> means
that it takes the hostname and resolves it with dns for a
fully qualified domain name of that machine. <i>Numeric</i>
is similar to fqd except it resolves the IP address of the
machine. In order to use this option, you might want to test
that &rsquo;hostname &minus;i&rsquo; or &rsquo;domainname
&minus;i&rsquo; returns a numeric address. Also, this option
is not recommended if dhcp is used because you could have
different addresses over time for the same machine.
<i>User</i> is an admin defined string from the name option.
The default value is <i>none</i>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><i>name</i></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This is the admin defined string that identifies the
machine if <i>user</i> is given as the <i>name_format</i>
option.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>max_log_file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This keyword specifies the
maximum file size in megabytes. When this limit is reached,
it will trigger a configurable action. The value given must
be numeric.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>max_log_file_action</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This parameter tells the system
what action to take when the system has detected that the
max file size limit has been reached. Valid values are
<i>ignore</i>, <i>syslog</i>, <i>suspend</i>, <i>rotate</i>
and <i>keep_logs.</i> If set to <i>ignore</i>, the audit
daemon does nothing. <i>syslog</i> means that it will issue
a warning to syslog. <i>suspend</i> will cause the audit
daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will
still be alive. The <i>rotate</i> option will cause the
audit daemon to rotate the logs. It should be noted that
logs with higher numbers are older than logs with lower
numbers. This is the same convention used by the logrotate
utility. The <i>keep_logs</i> option is similar to rotate
except it does not use the num_logs setting. This prevents
audit logs from being overwritten. The effect is that logs
accumulate and are not deleted &minus; which will trigger
the <i>space_left_action</i> if the volume fills up. This is
best used in combination with an external script used to
archive logs on a periodic basis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>action_mail_acct</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option should contain a
valid email address or alias. The default address is root.
If the email address is not local to the machine, you must
make sure you have email properly configured on your machine
and network. Also, this option requires that
/usr/lib/sendmail exists on the machine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>space_left</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a numeric value in
megabytes that tells the audit daemon when to perform a
configurable action because the system is starting to run
low on disk space.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>space_left_action</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This parameter tells the system
what action to take when the system has detected that it is
starting to get low on disk space. Valid values are
<i>ignore</i>, <i>syslog</i>, <i>rotate</i>, <i>email</i>,
<i>exec</i>, <i>suspend</i>, <i>single</i>, and <i>halt</i>.
If set to <i>ignore</i>, the audit daemon does nothing.
<i>syslog</i> means that it will issue a warning to syslog.
<i>rotate</i> will rotate logs, losing the oldest to free up
space. <i>Email</i> means that it will send a warning to the
email account specified in <i>action_mail_acct</i> as well
as sending the message to syslog. <i>exec</i>
/path-to-script will execute the script. You cannot pass
parameters to the script. The script is also responsible for
telling the auditd daemon to resume logging once its
completed its action. This can be done by adding service
auditd resume to the script. <i>suspend</i> will cause the
audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon
will still be alive. The <i>single</i> option will cause the
audit daemon to put the computer system in single user mode.
The <i>halt</i> option will cause the audit daemon to
shutdown the computer system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>admin_space_left</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a numeric value in
megabytes that tells the audit daemon when to perform a
configurable action because the system <b>is running low</b>
on disk space. This should be considered the last chance to
do something before running out of disk space. The numeric
value for this parameter should be lower than the number for
space_left.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>admin_space_left_action</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This parameter tells the system
what action to take when the system has detected that it
<b>is low on disk space.</b> Valid values are <i>ignore</i>,
<i>syslog</i>, <i>rotate</i>, <i>email</i>, <i>exec</i>,
<i>suspend</i>, <i>single</i>, and <i>halt</i>. If set to
<i>ignore</i>, the audit daemon does nothing. <i>Syslog</i>
means that it will issue a warning to syslog. <i>rotate</i>
will rotate logs, losing the oldest to free up space.
<i>Email</i> means that it will send a warning to the email
account specified in <i>action_mail_acct</i> as well as
sending the message to syslog. <i>exec</i> /path-to-script
will execute the script. You cannot pass parameters to the
script. The script is also responsible for telling the
auditd daemon to resume logging once its completed its
action. This can be done by adding service auditd resume to
the script. <i>Suspend</i> will cause the audit daemon to
stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will still be
alive. The <i>single</i> option will cause the audit daemon
to put the computer system in single user mode. The
<i>halt</i> option will cause the audit daemon to shutdown
the computer system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>disk_full_action</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This parameter tells the system
what action to take when the system has detected that the
partition to which log files are written has become full.
Valid values are <i>ignore</i>, <i>syslog</i>,
<i>rotate</i>, <i>exec</i>, <i>suspend</i>, <i>single</i>,
and <i>halt</i>. If set to <i>ignore</i>, the audit daemon
will issue a syslog message but no other action is taken.
<i>Syslog</i> means that it will issue a warning to syslog.
<i>rotate</i> will rotate logs, losing the oldest to free up
space. <i>exec</i> /path-to-script will execute the script.
You cannot pass parameters to the script. The script is also
responsible for telling the auditd daemon to resume loggin g
once its completed its action. This can be done by adding
service auditd resume to the script. <i>Suspend</i> will
cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk.
The daemon will still be alive. The <i>single</i> option
will cause the audit daemon to put the computer system in
single user mode. <i>halt</i> option will cause the audit
daemon to shutdown the computer system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>disk_error_action</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This parameter tells the system
what action to take whenever there is an error detected when
writing audit events to disk or rotating logs. Valid values
are <i>ignore</i>, <i>syslog</i>, <i>exec</i>,
<i>suspend</i>, <i>single</i>, and <i>halt</i>. If set to
<i>ignore</i>, the audit daemon will not take any action.
<i>Syslog</i> means that it will issue no more than 5
consecutive warnings to syslog. <i>exec</i> /path-to-script
will execute the script. You cannot pass parameters to the
script. <i>Suspend</i> will cause the audit daemon to stop
writing records to the disk. The daemon will still be alive.
The <i>single</i> option will cause the audit daemon to put
the computer system in single user mode. <i>halt</i> option
will cause the audit daemon to shutdown the computer
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>tcp_listen_port</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a numeric value in the
range 1..65535 which, if specified, causes auditd to listen
on the corresponding TCP port for audit records from remote
systems. The audit daemon may be linked with tcp_wrappers.
You may want to control access with an entry in the
hosts.allow and deny files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>tcp_listen_queue</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a numeric value which
indicates how many pending (requested but unaccepted)
connections are allowed. The default is 5. Setting this too
small may cause connections to be rejected if too many hosts
start up at exactly the same time, such as after a power
failure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>tcp_max_per_addr</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a numeric value which
indicates how many concurrent connections from one IP
address is allowed. The default is 1 and the maximum is
1024. Setting this too large may allow for a Denial of
Service attack on the logging server. Also note that the
kernel has an internal maximum that will eventually prevent
this even if auditd allows it by config. The default should
be adequate in most cases unless a custom written recovery
script runs to forward unsent events. In this case you would
increase the number only large enough to let it in too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>use_libwrap</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This setting determines whether
or not to use tcp_wrappers to discern connection attempts
that are from allowed machines. Legal values are either
<i>yes</i>, or <i>no</i> The default value is yes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>tcp_client_ports</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This parameter may be a single
numeric value or two values separated by a dash (no spaces
allowed). It indicates which client ports are allowed for
incoming connections. If not specified, any port is allowed.
Allowed values are 1..65535. For example, to require the
client use a priviledged port, specify <i>1&minus;1023</i>
for this parameter. You will also need to set the local_port
option in the audisp-remote.conf file. Making sure that
clients send from a privileged port is a security feature to
prevent log injection attacks by untrusted users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>tcp_client_max_idle</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This parameter indicates the
number of seconds that a client may be idle (i.e. no data
from them at all) before auditd complains. This is used to
close inactive connections if the client machine has a
problem where it cannot shutdown the connection cleanly.
Note that this is a global setting, and must be higher than
any individual client heartbeat_timeout setting, preferably
by a factor of two. The default is zero, which disables this
check.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>enable_krb5</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set to &quot;yes&quot;,
Kerberos 5 will be used for authentication and encryption.
The default is &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>krb5_principal</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the principal for this
server. The default is &quot;auditd&quot;. Given this
default, the server will look for a key named like
<i>auditd/hostname@EXAMPLE.COM</i> stored in
<i>/etc/audit/audit.key</i> to authenticate itself, where
hostname is the canonical name for the server&rsquo;s host,
as returned by a DNS lookup of its IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>krb5_key_file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Location of the key for this
client&rsquo;s principal. Note that the key file must be
owned by root and mode 0400. The default is
<i>/etc/audit/audit.key</i></p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a CAPP
environment, the audit trail is considered so important that
access to system resources must be denied if an audit trail
cannot be created. In this environment, it would be
suggested that /var/log/audit be on its own partition. This
is to ensure that space detection is accurate and that no
other process comes along and consumes part of it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The flush
parameter should be set to sync or data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Max_log_file
and num_logs need to be adjusted so that you get complete
use of your partition. It should be noted that the more
files that have to be rotated, the longer it takes to get
back to receiving audit events. Max_log_file_action should
be set to keep_logs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Space_left
should be set to a number that gives the admin enough time
to react to any alert message and perform some maintenance
to free up disk space. This would typically involve running
the <b>aureport &minus;t</b> report and moving the oldest
logs to an archive area. The value of space_left is site
dependent since the rate at which events are generated
varies with each deployment. The space_left_action is
recommended to be set to email. If you need something like
an snmp trap, you can use the exec option to send one.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Admin_space_left
should be set to the amount of disk space on the audit
partition needed for admin actions to be recorded.
Admin_space_left_action would be set to single so that use
of the machine is restricted to just the console.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
disk_full_action is triggered when no more room exists on
the partition. All access should be terminated since no more
audit capability exists. This can be set to either single or
halt.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
disk_error_action should be set to syslog, single, or halt
depending on your local policies regarding handling of
hardware malfunctions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Specifying a
single allowed client port may make it difficult for the
client to restart their audit subsystem, as it will be
unable to recreate a connection with the same host addresses
and ports until the connection closure TIME_WAIT state times
out.</p>
