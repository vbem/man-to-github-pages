<h2>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
<a name="WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[<b>&minus;closeenough&nbsp;</b><i>closeEnough</i>]
Specifies a floating-point value indicating how close the
mouse cursor must be to an item before it is considered to
be &ldquo;inside&rdquo; the item. Defaults to 1.0.
[<b>&minus;confine&nbsp;</b><i>confine</i>] Specifies a
boolean value that indicates whether or not it should be
allowable to set the canvas&rsquo;s view outside the region
defined by the <b>scrollRegion</b> argument. Defaults to
true, which means that the view will be constrained within
the scroll region. [<b>&minus;height&nbsp;</b><i>height</i>]
Specifies a desired window height that the canvas widget
should request from its geometry manager. The value may be
specified in any of the forms described in the
<b>COORDINATES</b> section below.
[<b>&minus;scrollregion&nbsp;</b><i>scrollRegion</i>]
Specifies a list with four coordinates describing the left,
top, right, and bottom coordinates of a rectangular region.
This region is used for scrolling purposes and is considered
to be the boundary of the information in the canvas. Each of
the coordinates may be specified in any of the forms given
in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section below.
[<b>&minus;state&nbsp;</b><i>state</i>] Modifies the default
state of the canvas where <i>state</i> may be set to one of:
<b>normal</b>, <b>disabled</b>, or <b>hidden</b>. Individual
canvas objects all have their own state option which may
override the default state. Many options can take separate
specifications such that the appearance of the item can be
different in different situations. The options that start
with <b>active</b> control the appearance when the mouse
pointer is over it, while the option starting with
<b>disabled</b> controls the appearance when the state is
disabled. Canvas items which are <b>disabled</b> will not
react to canvas bindings.
[<b>&minus;width&nbsp;</b><i>width</i>] Specifies a desired
window width that the canvas widget should request from its
geometry manager. The value may be specified in any of the
forms described in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section below.
[<b>&minus;xscrollincrement&nbsp;</b><i>xScrollIncrement</i>]
Specifies an increment for horizontal scrolling, in any of
the usual forms permitted for screen distances. If the value
of this option is greater than zero, the horizontal view in
the window will be constrained so that the canvas x
coordinate at the left edge of the window is always an even
multiple of <b>xScrollIncrement</b>; furthermore, the units
for scrolling (e.g., the change in view when the left and
right arrows of a scrollbar are selected) will also be
<b>xScrollIncrement</b>. If the value of this option is less
than or equal to zero, then horizontal scrolling is
unconstrained.
[<b>&minus;yscrollincrement&nbsp;</b><i>yScrollIncrement</i>]
Specifies an increment for vertical scrolling, in any of the
usual forms permitted for screen distances. If the value of
this option is greater than zero, the vertical view in the
window will be constrained so that the canvas y coordinate
at the top edge of the window is always an even multiple of
<b>yScrollIncrement</b>; furthermore, the units for
scrolling (e.g., the change in view when the top and bottom
arrows of a scrollbar are selected) will also be
<b>yScrollIncrement</b>. If the value of this option is less
than or equal to zero, then vertical scrolling is
unconstrained.

<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>canvas</b> command creates a new window (given by the
<i>pathName</i> argument) and makes it into a canvas widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
command line or in the option database to configure aspects
of the canvas such as its colors and 3-D relief. The
<b>canvas</b> command returns its <i>pathName</i> argument.
At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a
window named <i>pathName</i>, but <i>pathName</i>&rsquo;s
parent must exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Canvas widgets
implement structured graphics. A canvas displays any number
of <i>items</i>, which may be things like rectangles,
circles, lines, and text. Items may be manipulated (e.g.
moved or re-colored) and commands may be associated with
items in much the same way that the <b>bind</b> command
allows commands to be bound to widgets. For example, a
particular command may be associated with the
&lt;Button-1&gt; event so that the command is invoked
whenever button 1 is pressed with the mouse cursor over an
item. This means that items in a canvas can have behaviors
defined by the Tcl scripts bound to them.</p>

<h2>DISPLAY LIST
<a name="DISPLAY LIST"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The items in a
canvas are ordered for purposes of display, with the first
item in the display list being displayed first, followed by
the next item in the list, and so on. Items later in the
display list obscure those that are earlier in the display
list and are sometimes referred to as being &ldquo;on
top&rdquo; of earlier items. When a new item is created it
is placed at the end of the display list, on top of
everything else. Widget commands may be used to re-arrange
the order of the display list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Window items
are an exception to the above rules. The underlying window
systems require them always to be drawn on top of other
items. In addition, the stacking order of window items is
not affected by any of the canvas widget commands; you must
use the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b> Tk commands
instead.</p>

<h2>ITEM IDS AND TAGS
<a name="ITEM IDS AND TAGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Items in a
canvas widget may be named in either of two ways: by id or
by tag. Each item has a unique identifying number, which is
assigned to that item when it is created. The id of an item
never changes and id numbers are never re-used within the
lifetime of a canvas widget.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each item may
also have any number of <i>tags</i> associated with it. A
tag is just a string of characters, and it may take any form
except that of an integer. For example, &ldquo;x123&rdquo;
is OK but &ldquo;123&rdquo; is not. The same tag may be
associated with many different items. This is commonly done
to group items in various interesting ways; for example, all
selected items might be given the tag
&ldquo;selected&rdquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tag
<b>all</b> is implicitly associated with every item in the
canvas; it may be used to invoke operations on all the items
in the canvas.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tag
<b>current</b> is managed automatically by Tk; it applies to
the <i>current item</i>, which is the topmost item whose
drawn area covers the position of the mouse cursor
(different item types interpret this in varying ways; see
the individual item type documentation for details). If the
mouse is not in the canvas widget or is not over an item,
then no item has the <b>current</b> tag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When specifying
items in canvas widget commands, if the specifier is an
integer then it is assumed to refer to the single item with
that id. If the specifier is not an integer, then it is
assumed to refer to all of the items in the canvas that have
a tag matching the specifier. The symbol <i>tagOrId</i> is
used below to indicate that an argument specifies either an
id that selects a single item or a tag that selects zero or
more items.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>tagOrId</i>
may contain a logical expressions of tags by using
operators: &ldquo;<b>&amp;&amp;</b>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<b>||</b>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<b>^</b>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<b>!</b>&rdquo;, and parenthesized subexpressions.
For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">.c find withtag
{(a&amp;&amp;!b)||(!a&amp;&amp;b)}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">or equivalently:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">.c find withtag {a^b}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">will find only those items with
either &ldquo;a&rdquo; or &ldquo;b&rdquo; tags, but not
both.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some widget
commands only operate on a single item at a time; if
<i>tagOrId</i> is specified in a way that names multiple
items, then the normal behavior is for the command to use
the first (lowest) of these items in the display list that
is suitable for the command. Exceptions are noted in the
widget command descriptions below.</p>

<h2>COORDINATES
<a name="COORDINATES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All coordinates
related to canvases are stored as floating-point numbers.
Coordinates and distances are specified in screen units,
which are floating-point numbers optionally followed by one
of several letters. If no letter is supplied then the
distance is in pixels. If the letter is <b>m</b> then the
distance is in millimeters on the screen; if it is <b>c</b>
then the distance is in centimeters; <b>i</b> means inches,
and <b>p</b> means printers points (1/72 inch). Larger
y-coordinates refer to points lower on the screen; larger
x-coordinates refer to points farther to the right.
Coordinates can be specified either as an even number of
parameters, or as a single list parameter containing an even
number of x and y coordinate values.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>TRANSFORMATIONS</b>
<br>
Normally the origin of the canvas coordinate system is at
the upper-left corner of the window containing the canvas.
It is possible to adjust the origin of the canvas coordinate
system relative to the origin of the window using the
<b>xview</b> and <b>yview</b> widget commands; this is
typically used for scrolling. Canvases do not support
scaling or rotation of the canvas coordinate system relative
to the window coordinate system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Individual
items may be moved or scaled using widget commands described
below, but they may not be rotated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
default origin of the canvas&rsquo;s visible area is
coincident with the origin for the whole window as that
makes bindings using the mouse position easier to work with;
you only need to use the <b>canvasx</b> and <b>canvasy</b>
widget commands if you adjust the origin of the visible
area. However, this also means that any focus ring (as
controlled by the <b>&minus;highlightthickness</b> option)
and window border (as controlled by the
<b>&minus;borderwidth</b> option) must be taken into account
before you get to the visible area of the canvas.</p>

<h2>INDICES
<a name="INDICES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Text items
support the notion of an <i>index</i> for identifying
particular positions within the item. In a similar fashion,
line and polygon items support <i>index</i> for identifying,
inserting and deleting subsets of their coordinates. Indices
are used for commands such as inserting or deleting a range
of characters or coordinates, and setting the insertion
cursor position. An index may be specified in any of a
number of ways, and different types of items may support
different forms for specifying indices. Text items support
the following forms for an index; if you define new types of
text-like items, it would be advisable to support as many of
these forms as practical. Note that it is possible to refer
to the character just after the last one in the text item;
this is necessary for such tasks as inserting new text at
the end of the item. Lines and Polygons do not support the
insertion cursor and the selection. Their indices are
supposed to be even always, because coordinates always
appear in pairs.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="14%">


<p><i>number</i></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="74%">


<p>A decimal number giving the position of the desired
character within the text item. 0 refers to the first
character, 1 to the next character, and so on. If indexes
are odd for lines and polygons, they will be automatically
decremented by one. A number less than 0 is treated as if it
were zero, and a number greater than the length of the text
item is treated as if it were equal to the length of the
text item. For polygons, numbers less than 0 or greater then
the length of the coordinate list will be adjusted by adding
or subtracting the length until the result is between zero
and the length, inclusive.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="14%">


<p><b>end</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="74%">


<p>Refers to the character or coordinate just after the
last one in the item (same as the number of characters or
coordinates in the item).</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="14%">


<p><b>insert</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="74%">


<p>Refers to the character just before which the insertion
cursor is drawn in this item. Not valid for lines and
polygons.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="14%">


<p><b>sel.first</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="74%">


<p>Refers to the first selected character in the item. If
the selection is not in this item then this form is
illegal.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="14%">


<p><b>sel.last</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="74%">


<p>Refers to the last selected character in the item. If
the selection is not in this item then this form is
illegal.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="14%">


<p><b>@</b><i>x,y</i></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="74%">


<p>Refers to the character or coordinate at the point given
by <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are
specified in the coordinate system of the canvas. If
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> lie outside the coordinates covered by
the text item, then they refer to the first or last
character in the line that is closest to the given
point.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<h2>DASH PATTERNS
<a name="DASH PATTERNS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many items
support the notion of a dash pattern for outlines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
possible syntax is a list of integers. Each element
represents the number of pixels of a line segment. Only the
odd segments are drawn using the &ldquo;outline&rdquo;
color. The other segments are drawn transparent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
possible syntax is a character list containing only 5
possible characters &ldquo;<b>.,&minus;_</b> &rdquo;. The
space can be used to enlarge the space between other line
elements, and cannot occur as the first position in the
string. Some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">&minus;dash . &rarr;
&minus;dash {2 4} <br>
&minus;dash &minus; &rarr; &minus;dash {6 4} <br>
&minus;dash &minus;. &rarr; &minus;dash {6 4 2 4} <br>
&minus;dash &minus;.. &rarr; &minus;dash {6 4 2 4 2 4} <br>
&minus;dash {. } &rarr; &minus;dash {2 8} <br>
&minus;dash , &rarr; &minus;dash {4 4}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main
difference of this syntax with the previous is that it is
shape-conserving. This means that all values in the dash
list will be multiplied by the line width before display.
This assures that &ldquo;.&rdquo; will always be displayed
as a dot and &ldquo;&minus;&rdquo; always as a dash
regardless of the line width.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On systems
which support only a limited set of dash patterns, the dash
pattern will be displayed as the closest dash pattern that
is available. For example, on Windows only the first 4 of
the above examples are available. The last 2 examples will
be displayed identically to the first one.</p>

<h2>WIDGET COMMAND
<a name="WIDGET COMMAND"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>canvas</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name
is <i>pathName</i>. This command may be used to invoke
various operations on the widget. It has the following
general form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName option</i> ?<i>arg
arg ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>Option</i> and the
<i>arg</i>s determine the exact behavior of the command. The
following widget commands are possible for canvas widgets:
<i><br>
pathName</i> <b>addtag</b> <i>tag searchSpec</i> ?<i>arg arg
...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For each item that meets the
constraints specified by <i>searchSpec</i> and the
<i>arg</i>s, add <i>tag</i> to the list of tags associated
with the item if it is not already present on that list. It
is possible that no items will satisfy the constraints given
by <i>searchSpec</i> and <i>arg</i>s, in which case the
command has no effect. This command returns an empty string
as result. <i>SearchSpec</i> and <i>arg</i>&rsquo;s may take
any of the following forms: <b><br>
above</b> <i>tagOrId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Selects the item just after
(above) the one given by <i>tagOrId</i> in the display list.
If <i>tagOrId</i> denotes more than one item, then the last
(topmost) of these items in the display list is used.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><b>all</b></p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="56%">


<p>Selects all the items in the canvas.</p></td>
<td width="12%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>below</b> <i>tagOrId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Selects the item just before
(below) the one given by <i>tagOrId</i> in the display list.
If <i>tagOrId</i> denotes more than one item, then the first
(lowest) of these items in the display list is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>closest</b> <i>x y</i>
?<i>halo</i>? ?<i>start</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Selects the item closest to the
point given by <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. If more than one item
is at the same closest distance (e.g. two items overlap the
point), then the top-most of these items (the last one in
the display list) is used. If <i>halo</i> is specified, then
it must be a non-negative value. Any item closer than
<i>halo</i> to the point is considered to overlap it. The
<i>start</i> argument may be used to step circularly through
all the closest items. If <i>start</i> is specified, it
names an item using a tag or id (if by tag, it selects the
first item in the display list with the given tag). Instead
of selecting the topmost closest item, this form will select
the topmost closest item that is below <i>start</i> in the
display list; if no such item exists, then the selection
behaves as if the <i>start</i> argument had not been
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>enclosed</b> <i>x1 y1 x2
y2</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Selects all the items
completely enclosed within the rectangular region given by
<i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>, <i>x2</i>, and <i>y2</i>. <i>X1</i>
must be no greater then <i>x2</i> and <i>y1</i> must be no
greater than <i>y2</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>overlapping</b> <i>x1 y1 x2
y2</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Selects all the items that
overlap or are enclosed within the rectangular region given
by <i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>, <i>x2</i>, and <i>y2</i>. <i>X1</i>
must be no greater then <i>x2</i> and <i>y1</i> must be no
greater than <i>y2</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>withtag</b>
<i>tagOrId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Selects all the items given by
<i>tagOrId</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>bbox</b>
<i>tagOrId</i> ?<i>tagOrId tagOrId ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns a list with four
elements giving an approximate bounding box for all the
items named by the <i>tagOrId</i> arguments. The list has
the form &ldquo;<i>x1 y1 x2 y2</i>&rdquo; such that the
drawn areas of all the named elements are within the region
bounded by <i>x1</i> on the left, <i>x2</i> on the right,
<i>y1</i> on the top, and <i>y2</i> on the bottom. The
return value may overestimate the actual bounding box by a
few pixels. If no items match any of the <i>tagOrId</i>
arguments or if the matching items have empty bounding boxes
(i.e. they have nothing to display) then an empty string is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>bind</b>
<i>tagOrId</i> ?<i>sequence</i>? ?<i>command</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command associates
<i>command</i> with all the items given by <i>tagOrId</i>
such that whenever the event sequence given by
<i>sequence</i> occurs for one of the items the command will
be invoked. This widget command is similar to the
<b>bind</b> command except that it operates on items in a
canvas rather than entire widgets. See the <b>bind</b>
manual entry for complete details on the syntax of
<i>sequence</i> and the substitutions performed on
<i>command</i> before invoking it. If all arguments are
specified then a new binding is created, replacing any
existing binding for the same <i>sequence</i> and
<i>tagOrId</i> (if the first character of <i>command</i> is
&ldquo;+&rdquo; then <i>command</i> augments an existing
binding rather than replacing it). In this case the return
value is an empty string. If <i>command</i> is omitted then
the command returns the <i>command</i> associated with
<i>tagOrId</i> and <i>sequence</i> (an error occurs if there
is no such binding). If both <i>command</i> and
<i>sequence</i> are omitted then the command returns a list
of all the sequences for which bindings have been defined
for <i>tagOrId</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The only events
for which bindings may be specified are those related to the
mouse and keyboard (such as <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>,
<b>ButtonPress</b>, <b>Motion</b>, and <b>KeyPress</b>) or
virtual events. The handling of events in canvases uses the
current item defined in <b>ITEM IDS AND TAGS</b> above.
<b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events trigger for an item
when it becomes the current item or ceases to be the current
item; note that these events are different than <b>Enter</b>
and <b>Leave</b> events for windows. Mouse-related events
are directed to the current item, if any. Keyboard-related
events are directed to the focus item, if any (see the
<b>focus</b> widget command below for more on this). If a
virtual event is used in a binding, that binding can trigger
only if the virtual event is defined by an underlying
mouse-related or keyboard-related event.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
for multiple bindings to match a particular event. This
could occur, for example, if one binding is associated with
the item&rsquo;s id and another is associated with one of
the item&rsquo;s tags. When this occurs, all of the matching
bindings are invoked. A binding associated with the
<b>all</b> tag is invoked first, followed by one binding for
each of the item&rsquo;s tags (in order), followed by a
binding associated with the item&rsquo;s id. If there are
multiple matching bindings for a single tag, then only the
most specific binding is invoked. A <b>continue</b> command
in a binding script terminates that script, and a
<b>break</b> command terminates that script and skips any
remaining scripts for the event, just as for the <b>bind</b>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If bindings
have been created for a canvas window using the <b>bind</b>
command, then they are invoked in addition to bindings
created for the canvas&rsquo;s items using the <b>bind</b>
widget command. The bindings for items will be invoked
before any of the bindings for the window as a whole.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>canvasx</b>
<i>screenx</i> ?<i>gridspacing</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Given a window x-coordinate in
the canvas <i>screenx</i>, this command returns the canvas
x-coordinate that is displayed at that location. If
<i>gridspacing</i> is specified, then the canvas coordinate
is rounded to the nearest multiple of <i>gridspacing</i>
units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>canvasy</b>
<i>screeny</i> ?<i>gridspacing</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Given a window y-coordinate in
the canvas <i>screeny</i> this command returns the canvas
y-coordinate that is displayed at that location. If
<i>gridspacing</i> is specified, then the canvas coordinate
is rounded to the nearest multiple of <i>gridspacing</i>
units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>cget</b>
<i>option</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the current value of
the configuration option given by <i>option</i>.
<i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted by the
<b>canvas</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>configure
?</b><i>option</i>? ?<i>value</i>? ?<i>option value
...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Query or modify the
configuration options of the widget. If no <i>option</i> is
specified, returns a list describing all of the available
options for <i>pathName</i> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for
information on the format of this list). If <i>option</i> is
specified with no <i>value</i>, then the command returns a
list describing the one named option (this list will be
identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned
if no <i>option</i> is specified). If one or more
<i>option&minus;value</i> pairs are specified, then the
command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the
given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty
string. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted by
the <b>canvas</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>coords</b>
<i>tagOrId</i> ?<i>x0 y0 ...</i>? <i><br>
pathName</i> <b>coords</b> <i>tagOrId</i>
?<i>coordList</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Query or modify the coordinates
that define an item. If no coordinates are specified, this
command returns a list whose elements are the coordinates of
the item named by <i>tagOrId</i>. If coordinates are
specified, then they replace the current coordinates for the
named item. If <i>tagOrId</i> refers to multiple items, then
the first one in the display list is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>create</b>
<i>type x y</i> ?<i>x y ...</i>? ?<i>option value ...</i>?
<i><br>
pathName</i> <b>create</b> <i>type coordList</i> ?<i>option
value ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create a new item in
<i>pathName</i> of type <i>type</i>. The exact format of the
arguments after <b>type</b> depends on <b>type</b>, but
usually they consist of the coordinates for one or more
points, followed by specifications for zero or more item
options. See the subsections on individual item types below
for more on the syntax of this command. This command returns
the id for the new item.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>dchars</b>
<i>tagOrId first</i> ?<i>last</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For each item given by
<i>tagOrId</i>, delete the characters, or coordinates, in
the range given by <i>first</i> and <i>last</i>, inclusive.
If some of the items given by <i>tagOrId</i> do not support
indexing operations then they ignore dchars. Text items
interpret <i>first</i> and <i>last</i> as indices to a
character, line and polygon items interpret them indices to
a coordinate (an x,y pair). Indices are described in
<b>INDICES</b> above. If <i>last</i> is omitted, it defaults
to <i>first</i>. This command returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>delete</b>
?<i>tagOrId tagOrId ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Delete each of the items given
by each <i>tagOrId</i>, and return an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>dtag</b>
<i>tagOrId</i> ?<i>tagToDelete</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For each of the items given by
<i>tagOrId</i>, delete the tag given by <i>tagToDelete</i>
from the list of those associated with the item. If an item
does not have the tag <i>tagToDelete</i> then the item is
unaffected by the command. If <i>tagToDelete</i> is omitted
then it defaults to <i>tagOrId</i>. This command returns an
empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>find</b>
<i>searchCommand</i> ?<i>arg arg ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command returns a list
consisting of all the items that meet the constraints
specified by <i>searchCommand</i> and <i>arg</i>&rsquo;s.
<i>SearchCommand</i> and <i>args</i> have any of the forms
accepted by the <b>addtag</b> command. The items are
returned in stacking order, with the lowest item first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>focus</b>
?<i>tagOrId</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the keyboard focus for the
canvas widget to the item given by <i>tagOrId</i>. If
<i>tagOrId</i> refers to several items, then the focus is
set to the first such item in the display list that supports
the insertion cursor. If <i>tagOrId</i> does not refer to
any items, or if none of them support the insertion cursor,
then the focus is not changed. If <i>tagOrId</i> is an empty
string, then the focus item is reset so that no item has the
focus. If <i>tagOrId</i> is not specified then the command
returns the id for the item that currently has the focus, or
an empty string if no item has the focus.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Once the focus
has been set to an item, the item will display the insertion
cursor and all keyboard events will be directed to that
item. The focus item within a canvas and the focus window on
the screen (set with the <b>focus</b> command) are totally
independent: a given item does not actually have the input
focus unless (a) its canvas is the focus window and (b) the
item is the focus item within the canvas. In most cases it
is advisable to follow the <b>focus</b> widget command with
the <b>focus</b> command to set the focus window to the
canvas (if it was not there already).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>gettags</b>
<i>tagOrId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Return a list whose elements
are the tags associated with the item given by
<i>tagOrId</i>. If <i>tagOrId</i> refers to more than one
item, then the tags are returned from the first such item in
the display list. If <i>tagOrId</i> does not refer to any
items, or if the item contains no tags, then an empty string
is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>icursor</b>
<i>tagOrId index</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the position of the
insertion cursor for the item(s) given by <i>tagOrId</i> to
just before the character whose position is given by
<i>index</i>. If some or all of the items given by
<i>tagOrId</i> do not support an insertion cursor then this
command has no effect on them. See <b>INDICES</b> above for
a description of the legal forms for <i>index</i>. Note: the
insertion cursor is only displayed in an item if that item
currently has the keyboard focus (see the widget command
<b>focus</b>, below), but the cursor position may be set
even when the item does not have the focus. This command
returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>index</b>
<i>tagOrId index</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command returns a decimal
string giving the numerical index within <i>tagOrId</i>
corresponding to <i>index</i>. <i>Index</i> gives a textual
description of the desired position as described in
<b>INDICES</b> above. Text items interpret <i>index</i> as
an index to a character, line and polygon items interpret it
as an index to a coordinate (an x,y pair). The return value
is guaranteed to lie between 0 and the number of characters,
or coordinates, within the item, inclusive. If
<i>tagOrId</i> refers to multiple items, then the index is
processed in the first of these items that supports indexing
operations (in display list order).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>insert</b>
<i>tagOrId beforeThis string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For each of the items given by
<i>tagOrId</i>, if the item supports text or coordinate,
insertion then <i>string</i> is inserted into the
item&rsquo;s text just before the character, or coordinate,
whose index is <i>beforeThis</i>. Text items interpret
<i>beforeThis</i> as an index to a character, line and
polygon items interpret it as an index to a coordinate (an
x,y pair). For lines and polygons the <i>string</i> must be
a valid coordinate sequence. See <b>INDICES</b> above for
information about the forms allowed for <i>beforeThis</i>.
This command returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>itemcget</b>
<i>tagOrId option</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the current value of
the configuration option for the item given by
<i>tagOrId</i> whose name is <i>option</i>. This command is
similar to the <b>cget</b> widget command except that it
applies to a particular item rather than the widget as a
whole. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted by
the <b>create</b> widget command when the item was created.
If <i>tagOrId</i> is a tag that refers to more than one
item, the first (lowest) such item is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i>
<b>itemconfigure</b> <i>tagOrId</i> ?<i>option</i>?
?<i>value</i>? ?<i>option value ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command is similar to the
<b>configure</b> widget command except that it modifies
item-specific options for the items given by <i>tagOrId</i>
instead of modifying options for the overall canvas widget.
If no <i>option</i> is specified, returns a list describing
all of the available options for the first item given by
<i>tagOrId</i> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information
on the format of this list). If <i>option</i> is specified
with no <i>value</i>, then the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
<i>option</i> is specified). If one or more
<i>option&minus;value</i> pairs are specified, then the
command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the
given value(s) in each of the items given by <i>tagOrId</i>;
in this case the command returns an empty string. The
<i>option</i>s and <i>value</i>s are the same as those
permissible in the <b>create</b> widget command when the
item(s) were created; see the sections describing individual
item types below for details on the legal options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>lower</b>
<i>tagOrId</i> ?<i>belowThis</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Move all of the items given by
<i>tagOrId</i> to a new position in the display list just
before the item given by <i>belowThis</i>. If <i>tagOrId</i>
refers to more than one item then all are moved but the
relative order of the moved items will not be changed.
<i>BelowThis</i> is a tag or id; if it refers to more than
one item then the first (lowest) of these items in the
display list is used as the destination location for the
moved items. Note: this command has no effect on window
items. Window items always obscure other item types, and the
stacking order of window items is determined by the
<b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b> commands, not the <b>raise</b>
and <b>lower</b> widget commands for canvases. This command
returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>move</b>
<i>tagOrId xAmount yAmount</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Move each of the items given by
<i>tagOrId</i> in the canvas coordinate space by adding
<i>xAmount</i> to the x-coordinate of each point associated
with the item and <i>yAmount</i> to the y-coordinate of each
point associated with the item. This command returns an
empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i>
<b>postscript</b> ?<i>option value option value ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Generate a Postscript
representation for part or all of the canvas. If the
<b>&minus;file</b> option is specified then the Postscript
is written to a file and an empty string is returned;
otherwise the Postscript is returned as the result of the
command. If the interpreter that owns the canvas is marked
as safe, the operation will fail because safe interpreters
are not allowed to write files. If the <b>&minus;channel</b>
option is specified, the argument denotes the name of a
channel already opened for writing. The Postscript is
written to that channel, and the channel is left open for
further writing at the end of the operation. The Postscript
is created in Encapsulated Postscript form using version 3.0
of the Document Structuring Conventions. Note: by default
Postscript is only generated for information that appears in
the canvas&rsquo;s window on the screen. If the canvas is
freshly created it may still have its initial size of 1x1
pixel so nothing will appear in the Postscript. To get
around this problem either invoke the <b>update</b> command
to wait for the canvas window to reach its final size, or
else use the <b>&minus;width</b> and <b>&minus;height</b>
options to specify the area of the canvas to print. The
<i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> argument pairs provide
additional information to control the generation of
Postscript. The following options are supported: <b><br>
&minus;colormap</b> <i>varName</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><i>VarName</i> must be the name
of an array variable that specifies a color mapping to use
in the Postscript. Each element of <i>varName</i> must
consist of Postscript code to set a particular color value
(e.g. &ldquo;<b>1.0 1.0 0.0 setrgbcolor</b>&rdquo;). When
outputting color information in the Postscript, Tk checks to
see if there is an element of <i>varName</i> with the same
name as the color. If so, Tk uses the value of the element
as the Postscript command to set the color. If this option
has not been specified, or if there is no entry in
<i>varName</i> for a given color, then Tk uses the red,
green, and blue intensities from the X color.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;colormode</b>
<i>mode</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies how to output color
information. <i>Mode</i> must be either <b>color</b> (for
full color output), <b>gray</b> (convert all colors to their
gray-scale equivalents) or <b>mono</b> (convert all colors
to black or white).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;file</b>
<i>fileName</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies the name of the file
in which to write the Postscript. If this option is not
specified then the Postscript is returned as the result of
the command instead of being written to a file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;fontmap</b>
<i>varName</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><i>VarName</i> must be the name
of an array variable that specifies a font mapping to use in
the Postscript. Each element of <i>varName</i> must consist
of a Tcl list with two elements, which are the name and
point size of a Postscript font. When outputting Postscript
commands for a particular font, Tk checks to see if
<i>varName</i> contains an element with the same name as the
font. If there is such an element, then the font information
contained in that element is used in the Postscript.
Otherwise Tk attempts to guess what Postscript font to use.
Tk&rsquo;s guesses generally only work for well-known fonts
such as Times and Helvetica and Courier, and only if the X
font name does not omit any dashes up through the point
size. For example,
<b>&minus;*&minus;Courier&minus;Bold&minus;R&minus;Normal&minus;&minus;*&minus;120&minus;*</b>
will work but
<b>*Courier&minus;Bold&minus;R&minus;Normal*120*</b> will
not; Tk needs the dashes to parse the font name).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;height</b>
<i>size</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies the height of the
area of the canvas to print. Defaults to the height of the
canvas window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;pageanchor</b>
<i>anchor</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies which point of the
printed area of the canvas should appear over the
positioning point on the page (which is given by the
<b>&minus;pagex</b> and <b>&minus;pagey</b> options). For
example, <b>&minus;pageanchor n</b> means that the top
center of the area of the canvas being printed (as it
appears in the canvas window) should be over the positioning
point. Defaults to <b>center</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;pageheight</b>
<i>size</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies that the Postscript
should be scaled in both x and y so that the printed area is
<i>size</i> high on the Postscript page. <i>Size</i>
consists of a floating-point number followed by <b>c</b> for
centimeters, <b>i</b> for inches, <b>m</b> for millimeters,
or <b>p</b> or nothing for printer&rsquo;s points (1/72
inch). Defaults to the height of the printed area on the
screen. If both <b>&minus;pageheight</b> and
<b>&minus;pagewidth</b> are specified then the scale factor
from <b>&minus;pagewidth</b> is used (non-uniform scaling is
not implemented).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;pagewidth</b>
<i>size</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies that the Postscript
should be scaled in both x and y so that the printed area is
<i>size</i> wide on the Postscript page. <i>Size</i> has the
same form as for <b>&minus;pageheight</b>. Defaults to the
width of the printed area on the screen. If both
<b>&minus;pageheight</b> and <b>&minus;pagewidth</b> are
specified then the scale factor from <b>&minus;pagewidth</b>
is used (non-uniform scaling is not implemented).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;pagex</b>
<i>position</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><i>Position</i> gives the
x-coordinate of the positioning point on the Postscript
page, using any of the forms allowed for
<b>&minus;pageheight</b>. Used in conjunction with the
<b>&minus;pagey</b> and <b>&minus;pageanchor</b> options to
determine where the printed area appears on the Postscript
page. Defaults to the center of the page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;pagey</b>
<i>position</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><i>Position</i> gives the
y-coordinate of the positioning point on the Postscript
page, using any of the forms allowed for
<b>&minus;pageheight</b>. Used in conjunction with the
<b>&minus;pagex</b> and <b>&minus;pageanchor</b> options to
determine where the printed area appears on the Postscript
page. Defaults to the center of the page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;rotate</b>
<i>boolean</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><i>Boolean</i> specifies
whether the printed area is to be rotated 90 degrees. In
non-rotated output the x-axis of the printed area runs along
the short dimension of the page
(&ldquo;portrait&rdquo;orientation); in rotated output the
x-axis runs along the long dimension of the page
(&ldquo;landscape&rdquo;orientation). Defaults to
non-rotated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;width</b>
<i>size</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies the width of the area
of the canvas to print. Defaults to the width of the canvas
window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;x</b>
<i>position</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies the x-coordinate of
the left edge of the area of the canvas that is to be
printed, in canvas coordinates, not window coordinates.
Defaults to the coordinate of the left edge of the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;y</b>
<i>position</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies the y-coordinate of
the top edge of the area of the canvas that is to be
printed, in canvas coordinates, not window coordinates.
Defaults to the coordinate of the top edge of the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>raise</b>
<i>tagOrId</i> ?<i>aboveThis</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Move all of the items given by
<i>tagOrId</i> to a new position in the display list just
after the item given by <i>aboveThis</i>. If <i>tagOrId</i>
refers to more than one item then all are moved but the
relative order of the moved items will not be changed.
<i>AboveThis</i> is a tag or id; if it refers to more than
one item then the last (topmost) of these items in the
display list is used as the destination location for the
moved items. Note: this command has no effect on window
items. Window items always obscure other item types, and the
stacking order of window items is determined by the
<b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b> commands, not the <b>raise</b>
and <b>lower</b> widget commands for canvases. This command
returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>scale</b>
<i>tagOrId xOrigin yOrigin xScale yScale</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Rescale all of the items given
by <i>tagOrId</i> in canvas coordinate space. <i>XOrigin</i>
and <i>yOrigin</i> identify the origin for the scaling
operation and <i>xScale</i> and <i>yScale</i> identify the
scale factors for x- and y-coordinates, respectively (a
scale factor of 1.0 implies no change to that coordinate).
For each of the points defining each item, the x-coordinate
is adjusted to change the distance from <i>xOrigin</i> by a
factor of <i>xScale</i>. Similarly, each y-coordinate is
adjusted to change the distance from <i>yOrigin</i> by a
factor of <i>yScale</i>. This command returns an empty
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>scan</b>
<i>option args</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command is used to
implement scanning on canvases. It has two forms, depending
on <i>option</i>: <i><br>
pathName</i> <b>scan mark</b> <i>x y</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Records <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
and the canvas&rsquo;s current view; used in conjunction
with later <b>scan dragto</b> commands. Typically this
command is associated with a mouse button press in the
widget and <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the coordinates of the
mouse. It returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>scan
dragto</b> <i>x y ?gain?</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This command computes the
difference between its <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> arguments
(which are typically mouse coordinates) and the <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> arguments to the last <b>scan mark</b> command for
the widget. It then adjusts the view by <i>gain</i> times
the difference in coordinates, where <i>gain</i> defaults to
10. This command is typically associated with mouse motion
events in the widget, to produce the effect of dragging the
canvas at high speed through its window. The return value is
an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>select</b>
<i>option</i> ?<i>tagOrId arg</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Manipulates the selection in
one of several ways, depending on <i>option</i>. The command
may take any of the forms described below. In all of the
descriptions below, <i>tagOrId</i> must refer to an item
that supports indexing and selection; if it refers to
multiple items then the first of these that supports
indexing and the selection is used. <i>Index</i> gives a
textual description of a position within <i>tagOrId</i>, as
described in <b>INDICES</b> above. <i><br>
pathName</i> <b>select adjust</b> <i>tagOrId index</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Locate the end of the selection
in <i>tagOrId</i> nearest to the character given by
<i>index</i>, and adjust that end of the selection to be at
<i>index</i> (i.e. including but not going beyond
<i>index</i>). The other end of the selection is made the
anchor point for future <b>select to</b> commands. If the
selection is not currently in <i>tagOrId</i> then this
command behaves the same as the <b>select to</b> widget
command. Returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>select
clear</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Clear the selection if it is in
this widget. If the selection is not in this widget then the
command has no effect. Returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>select
from</b> <i>tagOrId index</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Set the selection anchor point
for the widget to be just before the character given by
<i>index</i> in the item given by <i>tagOrId</i>. This
command does not change the selection; it just sets the
fixed end of the selection for future <b>select to</b>
commands. Returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>select
item</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Returns the id of the selected
item, if the selection is in an item in this canvas. If the
selection is not in this canvas then an empty string is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>select
to</b> <i>tagOrId index</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Set the selection to consist of
those characters of <i>tagOrId</i> between the selection
anchor point and <i>index</i>. The new selection will
include the character given by <i>index</i>; it will include
the character given by the anchor point only if <i>index</i>
is greater than or equal to the anchor point. The anchor
point is determined by the most recent <b>select adjust</b>
or <b>select from</b> command for this widget. If the
selection anchor point for the widget is not currently in
<i>tagOrId</i>, then it is set to the same character given
by <i>index</i>. Returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>type</b>
<i>tagOrId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the type of the item
given by <i>tagOrId</i>, such as <b>rectangle</b> or
<b>text</b>. If <i>tagOrId</i> refers to more than one item,
then the type of the first item in the display list is
returned. If <i>tagOrId</i> does not refer to any items at
all then an empty string is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>xview</b>
?<i>args</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command is used to query
and change the horizontal position of the information
displayed in the canvas&rsquo;s window. It can take any of
the following forms: <i><br>
pathName</i> <b>xview</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Returns a list containing two
elements. Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1;
together they describe the horizontal span that is visible
in the window. For example, if the first element is .2 and
the second element is .6, 20% of the canvas&rsquo;s area (as
defined by the <b>&minus;scrollregion</b> option) is
off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the
window, and 40% of the canvas is off-screen to the right.
These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the
<b>&minus;xscrollcommand</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>xview
moveto</b> <i>fraction</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Adjusts the view in the window
so that <i>fraction</i> of the total width of the canvas is
off-screen to the left. <i>Fraction</i> must be a fraction
between 0 and 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>xview
scroll</b> <i>number what</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This command shifts the view in
the window left or right according to <i>number</i> and
<i>what</i>. <i>Number</i> must be an integer. <i>What</i>
must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an
abbreviation of one of these. If <i>what</i> is
<b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right in units of the
<b>xScrollIncrement</b> option, if it is greater than zero,
or in units of one-tenth the window&rsquo;s width otherwise.
If <i>what is</i> <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts in
units of nine-tenths the window&rsquo;s width. If
<i>number</i> is negative then information farther to the
left becomes visible; if it is positive then information
farther to the right becomes visible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>yview</b>
<i>?args</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command is used to query
and change the vertical position of the information
displayed in the canvas&rsquo;s window. It can take any of
the following forms: <i><br>
pathName</i> <b>yview</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Returns a list containing two
elements. Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1;
together they describe the vertical span that is visible in
the window. For example, if the first element is .6 and the
second element is 1.0, the lowest 40% of the canvas&rsquo;s
area (as defined by the <b>&minus;scrollregion</b> option)
is visible in the window. These are the same values passed
to scrollbars via the <b>&minus;yscrollcommand</b>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>yview
moveto</b> <i>fraction</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Adjusts the view in the window
so that <i>fraction</i> of the canvas&rsquo;s area is

scroll</b> <i>number what</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This command adjusts the view
in the window up or down according to <i>number</i> and
<i>what</i>. <i>Number</i> must be an integer. <i>What</i>
must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b>. If <i>what</i>
is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts up or down in units of the
<b>yScrollIncrement</b> option, if it is greater than zero,
or in units of one-tenth the window&rsquo;s height
otherwise. If <i>what</i> is <b>pages</b> then the view
adjusts in units of nine-tenths the window&rsquo;s height.
If <i>number</i> is negative then higher information becomes

<h2>OVERVIEW OF ITEM TYPES
<a name="OVERVIEW OF ITEM TYPES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sections
below describe the various types of items supported by
canvas widgets. Each item type is characterized by two
things: first, the form of the <b>create</b> command used to
create instances of the type; and second, a set of
configuration options for items of that type, which may be
used in the <b>create</b> and <b>itemconfigure</b> widget
commands. Most items do not support indexing or selection or
the commands related to them, such as <b>index</b> and
<b>insert</b>. Where items do support these facilities, it
is noted explicitly in the descriptions below. At present,
text, line and polygon items provide this support. For lines
and polygons the indexing facility is used to manipulate the
coordinates of the item.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>COMMON ITEM
OPTIONS</b> <br>
Many items share a common set of options. These options are
explained here, and then referred to be each widget type for
brevity. <b><br>
&minus;dash</b> <i>pattern</i> <b><br>
&minus;activedash</b> <i>pattern</i> <b><br>
&minus;disableddash</b> <i>pattern</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies dash
patterns for the normal, active state, and disabled state of
an item. <i>pattern</i> may have any of the forms accepted
by <b>Tk_GetDash</b>. If the dash options are omitted then
the default is a solid outline. See <b>DASH PATTERNS</b> for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;dashoffset</b>
<i>offset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The starting <i>offset</i> in
pixels into the pattern provided by the <b>&minus;dash</b>
option. <b>&minus;dashoffset</b> is ignored if there is no
<b>&minus;dash</b> pattern. The <i>offset</i> may have any
of the forms described in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section
above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;fill</b> <i>color</i>
<b><br>
&minus;activefill</b> <i>color</i> <b><br>
&minus;disabledfill</b> <i>color</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the color to be used
to fill item&rsquo;s area. in its normal, active, and
disabled states, <i>Color</i> may have any of the forms
accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>. If <i>color</i> is an empty
string (the default), then the item will not be filled. For
the line item, it specifies the color of the line drawn. For
the text item, it specifies the foreground color of the
text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;outline</b>
<i>color</i> <b><br>
&minus;activeoutline</b> <i>color</i> <b><br>
&minus;disabledoutline</b> <i>color</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies the color
that should be used to draw the outline of the item in its
normal, active and disabled states. <i>Color</i> may have
any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>. This option
defaults to <b>black</b>. If <i>color</i> is specified as an
empty string then no outline is drawn for the item.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;offset</b>
<i>offset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the offset of
stipples. The offset value can be of the form <b>x,y</b> or
<b>side</b>, where side can be <b>n</b>, <b>ne</b>,
<b>e</b>, <b>se</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>sw</b>, <b>w</b>,
<b>nw</b>, or <b>center</b>. In the first case the origin is
the origin of the toplevel of the current window. For the
canvas itself and canvas objects the origin is the canvas
origin, but putting <b>#</b> in front of the coordinate pair
indicates using the toplevel origin instead. For canvas
objects, the <b>&minus;offset</b> option is used for
stippling as well. For the line and polygon canvas items you
can also specify an index as argument, which connects the
stipple origin to one of the coordinate points of the
line/polygon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;outlinestipple</b>
<i>bitmap</i> <b><br>
&minus;activeoutlinestipple</b> <i>bitmap</i> <b><br>
&minus;disabledoutlinestipple</b> <i>bitmap</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies stipple
patterns that should be used to draw the outline of the item
in its normal, active and disabled states. Indicates that
the outline for the item should be drawn with a stipple
pattern; <i>bitmap</i> specifies the stipple pattern to use,
in any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>. If the
<b>&minus;outline</b> option has not been specified then
this option has no effect. If <i>bitmap</i> is an empty
string (the default), then the outline is drawn in a solid
fashion. <i>Note that stipples are not well supported on
platforms that do not use X11 as their drawing API.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;outlineoffset</b>
<i>offset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the offset of the
stipple pattern used for outlines. The offset value can be
of the form &ldquo;<i>x</i><b>,</b><i>y</i>&rdquo; or the
description of a side (one of <b>n</b>, <b>ne</b>, <b>e</b>,
<b>se</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>sw</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>nw</b>, or
<b>center</b>). This option only has an effect when the
outline is drawn as a stipple pattern, and is only supported
under X11.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;stipple</b>
<i>bitmap</i> <b><br>
&minus;activestipple</b> <i>bitmap</i> <b><br>
&minus;disabledstipple</b> <i>bitmap</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies stipple
patterns that should be used to fill the item in its normal,
active and disabled states. <i>bitmap</i> specifies the
stipple pattern to use, in any of the forms accepted by
<b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>. If the <b>&minus;fill</b> option has
not been specified then this option has no effect. If
<i>bitmap</i> is an empty string (the default), then filling
is done in a solid fashion. For the text item, it affects
the actual text. <i>Note that stipples are not well
supported on platforms that do not use X11 as their drawing
API.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;state</b>
<i>state</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This allows an item to override
the canvas widget&rsquo;s global <i>state</i> option. It
takes the same values: <i>normal</i>, <i>disabled</i> or
<i>hidden</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;tags</b>
<i>tagList</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a set of tags to
apply to the item. <i>TagList</i> consists of a list of tag
names, which replace any existing tags for the item.
<i>TagList</i> may be an empty list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;width</b>
<i>outlineWidth</i> <b><br>
&minus;activewidth</b> <i>outlineWidth</i> <b><br>
&minus;disabledwidth</b> <i>outlineWidth</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the width of the
outline to be drawn around the item&rsquo;s region, in its
normal, active and disabled states. <i>outlineWidth</i> may
be in any of the forms described in the <b>COORDINATES</b>
section above. If the <b>&minus;outline</b> option has been
specified as an empty string then this option has no effect.
This option defaults to 1.0. For arcs, wide outlines will be
drawn centered on the edges of the arc&rsquo;s region.</p>

<h2>ARC ITEMS
<a name="ARC ITEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Items of type
<b>arc</b> appear on the display as arc-shaped regions. An
arc is a section of an oval delimited by two angles
(specified by the <b>&minus;start</b> and
<b>&minus;extent</b> options) and displayed in one of
several ways (specified by the <b>&minus;style</b> option).
Arcs are created with widget commands of the following
form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>create
arc</b> <i>x1 y1 x2 y2</i> ?<i>option value option value
...</i>? <i><br>
pathName</i> <b>create arc</b> <i>coordList</i> ?<i>option
value option value ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The arguments <i>x1</i>,
<i>y1</i>, <i>x2</i>, and <i>y2</i> or <i>coordList</i> give
the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of a
rectangular region enclosing the oval that defines the arc.
After the coordinates there may be any number of
<i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs, each of which sets
one of the configuration options for the item. These same
<i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs may be used in
<b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the
item&rsquo;s configuration. An arc item becomes the current
item when the mouse pointer is over any part that is painted
or (when fully transparent) that would be painted if both
the <b>&minus;fill</b> and <b>&minus;outline</b> options
were non-empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
standard options are supported by arcs:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">&minus;dash <br>

&minus;disabledstipple <br>
&minus;state <br>
&minus;tags <br>
&minus;width <br>
&minus;activewidth <br>
&minus;disabledwidth</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The following extra options are
supported for arcs: <b><br>
&minus;extent</b> <i>degrees</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the size of the
angular range occupied by the arc. The arc&rsquo;s range
extends for <i>degrees</i> degrees counter-clockwise from
the starting angle given by the <b>&minus;start</b> option.
<i>Degrees</i> may be negative. If it is greater than 360 or
less than &minus;360, then <i>degrees</i> modulo 360 is used
as the extent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;start</b>
<i>degrees</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the beginning of the
angular range occupied by the arc. <i>Degrees</i> is given
in units of degrees measured counter-clockwise from the
3-o&rsquo;clock position; it may be either positive or
negative.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;style</b>
<i>type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies how to draw the arc.
If <i>type</i> is <b>pieslice</b> (the default) then the
arc&rsquo;s region is defined by a section of the
oval&rsquo;s perimeter plus two line segments, one between
the center of the oval and each end of the perimeter
section. If <i>type</i> is <b>chord</b> then the arc&rsquo;s
region is defined by a section of the oval&rsquo;s perimeter
plus a single line segment connecting the two end points of
the perimeter section. If <i>type</i> is <b>arc</b> then the
arc&rsquo;s region consists of a section of the perimeter
alone. In this last case the <b>&minus;fill</b> option is
ignored.</p>

<h2>BITMAP ITEMS
<a name="BITMAP ITEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Items of type
<b>bitmap</b> appear on the display as images with two
colors, foreground and background. Bitmaps are created with
widget commands of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>create
bitmap</b> <i>x y</i> ?<i>option value option value ...</i>?
<i><br>
pathName</i> <b>create bitmap</b> <i>coordList</i>
?<i>option value option value ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The arguments <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> or <i>coordList</i> (which must have two elements)
specify the coordinates of a point used to position the
bitmap on the display (see the <b>&minus;anchor</b> option
below for more information on how bitmaps are displayed).
After the coordinates there may be any number of
<i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs, each of which sets
one of the configuration options for the item. These same
<i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs may be used in
<b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the
item&rsquo;s configuration. A bitmap item becomes the
current item when the mouse pointer is over any part of its
bounding box.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
standard options are supported by bitmaps:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">&minus;state <br>
&minus;tags</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The following extra options are
supported for bitmaps: <b><br>
&minus;anchor</b> <i>anchorPos</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>AnchorPos</i> tells how to
position the bitmap relative to the positioning point for
the item; it may have any of the forms accepted by
<b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>. For example, if <i>anchorPos</i> is
<b>center</b> then the bitmap is centered on the point; if
<i>anchorPos</i> is <b>n</b> then the bitmap will be drawn
so that its top center point is at the positioning point.
This option defaults to <b>center</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;background</b>
<i>color</i> <b><br>
&minus;activebackground</b> <i>color</i> <b><br>
&minus;disabledbackground</b> <i>color</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the color to use for
each of the bitmap&rsquo;s &ldquo;0&rdquo; valued pixels in
its normal, active and disabled states. <i>Color</i> may
have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>. If
this option is not specified, or if it is specified as an
empty string, then nothing is displayed where the bitmap
pixels are 0; this produces a transparent effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;bitmap</b>
<i>bitmap</i> <b><br>
&minus;activebitmap</b> <i>bitmap</i> <b><br>
&minus;disabledbitmap</b> <i>bitmap</i></p>

each of the bitmap&rsquo;s &ldquo;1&rdquo; valued pixels in
its normal, active and disabled states. <i>Color</i> may
have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b> and
defaults to <b>black</b>.</p>

<h2>IMAGE ITEMS
<a name="IMAGE ITEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Items of type
<b>image</b> are used to display images on a canvas. Images
are created with widget commands of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>create
image</b> <i>x y</i> ?<i>option value option value ...</i>?
<i><br>
pathName</i> <b>create image</b> <i>coordList</i> ?<i>option

disabled states. This image must have been created
previously with the <b>image create</b> command.</p>

<h2>LINE ITEMS
<a name="LINE ITEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Items of type
<b>line</b> appear on the display as one or more connected
line segments or curves. Line items support coordinate
indexing operations using the canvas widget commands:
<b>dchars, index, insert.</b> Lines are created with widget
commands of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>create
line</b> <i>x1 y1... xn yn</i> ?<i>option value option value
...</i>? <i><br>
pathName</i> <b>create line</b> <i>coordList</i> ?<i>option
value option value ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The arguments <i>x1</i> through
<i>yn</i> or <i>coordList</i> give the coordinates for a
series of two or more points that describe a series of
connected line segments. After the coordinates there may be
any number of <i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs, each
of which sets one of the configuration options for the item.
These same <i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs may be
used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the
item&rsquo;s configuration. A line item is the current item
whenever the mouse pointer is over any segment of the line,
whether drawn or not and whether or not the line is
smoothed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
standard options are supported by lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The following extra options are
supported for lines: <b><br>
&minus;arrow</b> <i>where</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Indicates whether or not
arrowheads are to be drawn at one or both ends of the line.
<i>Where</i> must have one of the values <b>none</b> (for no
arrowheads), <b>first</b> (for an arrowhead at the first
point of the line), <b>last</b> (for an arrowhead at the
last point of the line), or <b>both</b> (for arrowheads at
both ends). This option defaults to <b>none</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;arrowshape</b>
<i>shape</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option indicates how to
draw arrowheads. The <i>shape</i> argument must be a list
with three elements, each specifying a distance in any of
the forms described in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section above.
The first element of the list gives the distance along the
line from the neck of the arrowhead to its tip. The second
element gives the distance along the line from the trailing
points of the arrowhead to the tip, and the third element
gives the distance from the outside edge of the line to the
trailing points. If this option is not specified then Tk
picks a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; shape.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;capstyle</b>
<i>style</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the ways in which
caps are to be drawn at the endpoints of the line.
<i>Style</i> may have any of the forms accepted by
<b>Tk_GetCapStyle</b> (<b>butt</b>, <b>projecting</b>, or

defaults to <b>round</b>. If the line only contains two
points then this option is irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;smooth</b>
<i>smoothMethod</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>smoothMethod</i> must have
one of the forms accepted by <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b> or a line
smoothing method. Only <b>true</b> and <b>raw</b>
<big>&#9474;</big> are supported in the core (with
<b>bezier</b> being an alias for <b>true</b>),
<big>&#9474;</big> but more can be added at runtime. If a
boolean false value or <big>&#9474;</big> empty string is
given, no smoothing is applied. A boolean truth
<big>&#9474;</big> value assumes <b>true</b> smoothing. If
the smoothing method is <b>true</b>, <big>&#9474;</big> this
indicates that the line should be drawn as a curve,
<big>&#9474;</big> rendered as a set of quadratic splines:
one spline is drawn for <big>&#9474;</big> the first and
second line segments, one for the second and
<big>&#9474;</big> third, and so on. Straight-line segments
can be generated <big>&#9474;</big> within a curve by
duplicating the end-points of the desired line
<big>&#9474;</big> segment. If the smoothing method is
<b>raw</b>, this indicates that <big>&#9474;</big> the line
should also be drawn as a curve but where the list of
<big>&#9474;</big> coordinates is such that the first
coordinate pair (and every <big>&#9474;</big> third
coordinate pair thereafter) is a knot point on a cubic
<big>&#9474;</big> Bezier curve, and the other coordinates
are control points on <big>&#9474;</big> the cubic Bezier
curve. Straight line segments can be generated
<big>&#9474;</big> within a curve by making control points
equal to their <big>&#9474;</big> neighbouring knot points.
If the last point is a control point <big>&#9474;</big> and
not a knot point, the point is repeated (one or two times)
<big>&#9474;</big> so that it also becomes a knot point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;splinesteps</b>
<i>number</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the degree of
smoothness desired for curves: each spline will be
approximated with <i>number</i> line segments. This option
is ignored unless the <b>&minus;smooth</b> option is true or
<b>raw</b>.</p>

<h2>OVAL ITEMS
<a name="OVAL ITEMS"></a>

the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of a
rectangular region enclosing the oval. The oval will include
the top and left edges of the rectangle not the lower or
right edges. If the region is square then the resulting oval
is circular; otherwise it is elongated in shape. After the
coordinates there may be any number of
<i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs, each of which sets
one of the configuration options for the item. These same
<i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs may be used in
<b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the
item&rsquo;s configuration. An oval item becomes the current
item when the mouse pointer is over any part that is painted
or (when fully transparent) that would be painted if both
the <b>&minus;fill</b> and <b>&minus;outline</b> options
were non-empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following

<h2>POLYGON ITEMS
<a name="POLYGON ITEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Items of type
<b>polygon</b> appear as polygonal or curved filled regions
on the display. Polygon items support coordinate indexing
operations using the canvas widget commands: <b>dchars,
index, insert.</b> Polygons are created with widget commands
of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>create
polygon</b> <i>x1 y1 ... xn yn</i> ?<i>option value option
value ...</i>? <i><br>
pathName</i> <b>create polygon</b> <i>coordList</i>
?<i>option value option value ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The arguments <i>x1</i> through
<i>yn</i> or <i>coordList</i> specify the coordinates for
three or more points that define a polygon. The first point
should not be repeated as the last to close the shape; Tk
will automatically close the periphery between the first and
last points. After the coordinates there may be any number
of <i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs, each of which
sets one of the configuration options for the item. These
same <i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs may be used in
<b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the
item&rsquo;s configuration. A polygon item is the current
item whenever the mouse pointer is over any part of the
polygon, whether drawn or not and whether or not the outline
is smoothed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
standard options are supported by polygons:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">&minus;dash <br>
&minus;activedash <br>
&minus;disableddash <br>
&minus;dashoffset <br>
&minus;fill <br>

&minus;disabledstipple <br>
&minus;state <br>
&minus;tags <br>
&minus;width <br>
&minus;activewidth <br>
&minus;disabledwidth</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The following extra options are
supported for polygons: <b><br>
&minus;joinstyle</b> <i>style</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the ways in which
joints are to be drawn at the vertices of the outline.
<i>Style</i> may have any of the forms accepted by
<b>Tk_GetCapStyle</b> (<b>bevel</b>, <b>miter</b>, or
<b>round</b>). If this option is not specified then it
defaults to <b>round</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;smooth</b>
<i>boolean</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>Boolean</i> must have one of
the forms accepted by <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b> or
<big>&#9474;</big> a line smoothing method. Only <b>true</b>
and <b>raw</b> are supported in the <big>&#9474;</big> core
(with <b>bezier</b> being an alias for <b>true</b>), but
more can be <big>&#9474;</big> added at runtime. If a
boolean false value or empty string is <big>&#9474;</big>
given, no smoothing is applied. A boolean truth value
assumes <big>&#9474;</big> <b>true</b> smoothing. If the
smoothing method is <b>true</b>, this indicates
<big>&#9474;</big> that the polygon should be drawn as a
curve, rendered as a set <big>&#9474;</big> of quadratic
splines: one spline is drawn for the first and
<big>&#9474;</big> second line segments, one for the second
and third, and so on. <big>&#9474;</big> Straight-line
segments can be generated within a curve by
<big>&#9474;</big> duplicating the end-points of the desired
line segment. If the <big>&#9474;</big> smoothing method is
<b>raw</b>, this indicates that the polygon should
<big>&#9474;</big> also be drawn as a curve but where the
list of coordinates is <big>&#9474;</big> such that the
first coordinate pair (and every third coordinate
<big>&#9474;</big> pair thereafter) is a knot point on a
cubic Bezier curve, and <big>&#9474;</big> the other
coordinates are control points on the cubic Bezier
<big>&#9474;</big> curve. Straight line segments can be
venerated within a curve <big>&#9474;</big> by making
control points equal to their neighbouring knot
<big>&#9474;</big> points. If the last point is not the
second point of a pair of <big>&#9474;</big> control points,
the point is repeated (one or two times) so that
<big>&#9474;</big> it also becomes the second point of a
pair of control points <big>&#9474;</big> (the associated
knot point will be the first control point).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;splinesteps</b>
<i>number</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the degree of
smoothness desired for curves: each spline will be
approximated with <i>number</i> line segments. This option
is ignored unless the <b>&minus;smooth</b> option is true or
<b>raw</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Polygon items
are different from other items such as rectangles, ovals and
arcs in that interior points are considered to be
&ldquo;inside&rdquo; a polygon (e.g. for purposes of the
<b>find closest</b> and <b>find overlapping</b> widget
commands) even if it is not filled. For most other item
types, an interior point is considered to be inside the item
only if the item is filled or if it has neither a fill nor
an outline. If you would like an unfilled polygon whose
interior points are not considered to be inside the polygon,
use a line item instead.</p>

<h2>RECTANGLE ITEMS
<a name="RECTANGLE ITEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Items of type
<b>rectangle</b> appear as rectangular regions on the
display. Each rectangle may have an outline, a fill, or
both. Rectangles are created with widget commands of the
following form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>create
rectangle</b> <i>x1 y1 x2 y2</i> ?<i>option value option
value ...</i>? <i><br>
pathName</i> <b>create rectangle</b> <i>coordList</i>
?<i>option value option value ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The arguments <i>x1</i>,
<i>y1</i>, <i>x2</i>, and <i>y2</i> or <i>coordList</i>
(which must have four elements) give the coordinates of two
diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle (the rectangle
will include its upper and left edges but not its lower or
right edges). After the coordinates there may be any number
of <i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs, each of which
sets one of the configuration options for the item. These
same <i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs may be used in
<b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the
item&rsquo;s configuration. A rectangle item becomes the
current item when the mouse pointer is over any part that is
painted or (when fully transparent) that would be painted if
both the <b>&minus;fill</b> and <b>&minus;outline</b>
options were non-empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following

<h2>TEXT ITEMS
<a name="TEXT ITEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A text item
displays a string of characters on the screen in one or more
lines. Text items support indexing and selection, along with
the following text-related canvas widget commands:
<b>dchars</b>, <b>focus</b>, <b>icursor</b>, <b>index</b>,
<b>insert</b>, <b>select</b>. Text items are created with
widget commands of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>create
text</b> <i>x y</i> ?<i>option value option value ...</i>?
<i><br>
pathName</i> <b>create text</b> <i>coordList</i> ?<i>option
value option value ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The arguments <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> or <i>coordList</i> (which must have two elements)
specify the coordinates of a point used to position the text
on the display (see the options below for more information
on how text is displayed). After the coordinates there may
be any number of <i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs,
each of which sets one of the configuration options for the
item. These same <i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs may
be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change
the item&rsquo;s configuration. A text item becomes the
current item when the mouse pointer is over any part of its
bounding box.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
standard options are supported by text items:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">&minus;fill <br>
&minus;activefill <br>
&minus;disabledfill <br>
&minus;stipple <br>
&minus;activestipple <br>
&minus;disabledstipple <br>
&minus;state <br>
&minus;tags</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The following extra options are
supported for text items: <b><br>
&minus;anchor</b> <i>anchorPos</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>AnchorPos</i> tells how to
position the text relative to the positioning point for the
text; it may have any of the forms accepted by
<b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>. For example, if <i>anchorPos</i> is
<b>center</b> then the text is centered on the point; if
<i>anchorPos</i> is <b>n</b> then the text will be drawn
such that the top center point of the rectangular region
occupied by the text will be at the positioning point. This
option defaults to <b>center</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;font</b>
<i>fontName</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the font to use for
the text item. <i>FontName</i> may be any string acceptable
to <b>Tk_GetFont</b>. If this option is not specified, it
defaults to a system-dependent font.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;justify</b>
<i>how</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies how to justify the
text within its bounding region. <i>How</i> must be one of
the values <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>. This
option will only matter if the text is displayed as multiple
lines. If the option is omitted, it defaults to
<b>left</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;text</b>
<i>string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>String</i> specifies the
characters to be displayed in the text item. Newline
characters cause line breaks. The characters in the item may
also be changed with the <b>insert</b> and <b>delete</b>
widget commands. This option defaults to an empty string.
<big>&#9474;</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;underline</b>
<big>&#9474;</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the integer index of
a character within the text to be <big>&#9474;</big>
underlined. 0 corresponds to the first character of the text
<big>&#9474;</big> displayed, 1 to the next character, and
so on. &minus;1 means that no <big>&#9474;</big> underline
should be drawn (if the whole text item is to be
<big>&#9474;</big> underlined, the appropriate font should
be used instead).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;width</b>
<i>lineLength</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a maximum line length
for the text, in any of the forms described in the
<b>COORDINATES</b> section above. If this option is zero
(the default) the text is broken into lines only at newline
characters. However, if this option is non-zero then any
line that would be longer than <i>lineLength</i> is broken
just before a space character to make the line shorter than
<i>lineLength</i>; the space character is treated as if it
were a newline character.</p>

<h2>WINDOW ITEMS
<a name="WINDOW ITEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Items of type
<b>window</b> cause a particular window to be displayed at a
given position on the canvas. Window items are created with
widget commands of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>create
window</b> <i>x y</i> ?<i>option value option value ...</i>?
<i><br>
pathName</i> <b>create window</b> <i>coordList</i>
?<i>option value option value ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The arguments <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> or <i>coordList</i> (which must have two elements)
specify the coordinates of a point used to position the
window on the display (see the <b>&minus;anchor</b> option
below for more information on how bitmaps are displayed).
After the coordinates there may be any number of
<i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs, each of which sets
one of the configuration options for the item. These same
<i>option</i>&minus;<i>value</i> pairs may be used in
<b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the
item&rsquo;s configuration. Theoretically, a window item
becomes the current item when the mouse pointer is over any
part of its bounding box, but in practice this typically
does not happen because the mouse pointer ceases to be over
the canvas at that point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
standard options are supported by window items:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">&minus;state <br>
&minus;tags</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The following extra options are
supported for window items: <b><br>
&minus;anchor</b> <i>anchorPos</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>AnchorPos</i> tells how to
position the window relative to the positioning point for
the item; it may have any of the forms accepted by
<b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>. For example, if <i>anchorPos</i> is
<b>center</b> then the window is centered on the point; if
<i>anchorPos</i> is <b>n</b> then the window will be drawn
so that its top center point is at the positioning point.
This option defaults to <b>center</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;height</b>
<i>pixels</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the height to assign
to the item&rsquo;s window. <i>Pixels</i> may have any of
the forms described in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section above.
If this option is not specified, or if it is specified as
zero, then the window is given whatever height it requests
internally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;width</b>
<i>pixels</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the width to assign
to the item&rsquo;s window. <i>Pixels</i> may have any of
the forms described in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section above.
If this option is not specified, or if it is specified as
zero, then the window is given whatever width it requests
internally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;window</b>
<i>pathName</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the window to
associate with this item. The window specified by
<i>pathName</i> must either be a child of the canvas widget
or a child of some ancestor of the canvas widget.
<i>PathName</i> may not refer to a top-level window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: due to
restrictions in the ways that windows are managed, it is not
possible to draw other graphical items (such as lines and
images) on top of window items. A window item always
obscures any graphics that overlap it, regardless of their
order in the display list. Also note that window items,
unlike other canvas items, are not clipped for display by
their containing canvas&rsquo;s border, and are instead
clipped by the parent widget of the window specified by the
<b>&minus;window</b> option; when the parent widget is the
canvas, this means that the window item can overlap the
canvas&rsquo;s border.</p>

<h2>APPLICATION-DEFINED ITEM TYPES

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tk&rsquo;s
canvas widget is a blatant ripoff of ideas from Joel
