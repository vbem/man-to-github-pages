<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>yum</b> is
an interactive, rpm based, package manager. It can
automatically perform system updates, including dependency
analysis and obsolete processing based on
&quot;repository&quot; metadata. It can also perform
installation of new packages, removal of old packages and
perform queries on the installed and/or available packages
among many other commands/services (see below). <b>yum</b>
is similar to other high level package managers like
apt&minus;get and smart.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While there are
some graphical interfaces directly to the <b>yum</b> code,
more recent graphical interface development is happening
with PackageKit and the gnome&minus;packagekit
application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unless the
&minus;&minus;help or &minus;h option is given, one of the
above commands must be present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Repository
configuration is honored in all operations. <b><br>
install</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Is used to install the latest
version of a package or group of packages while ensuring
that all dependencies are satisfied. (See <b>Specifying
package names</b> for more information) If no package
matches the given package name(s), they are assumed to be a
shell glob and any matches are then installed. If the name
starts with @^ then it is treated as an environment group
(group install @^foo), an @ character and it&rsquo;s treated
as a group (plain group install).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the name
starts with a &quot;-&quot; character, then a search is done
within the transaction and any matches are removed. Note
that Yum options use the same syntax and it may be necessary
to use &quot;--&quot; to resolve any possible conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the name is
a file, then install works like localinstall. If the name
doesn&rsquo;t match a package, then package
&quot;provides&quot; are searched (e.g.
&quot;_sqlitecache.so()(64bit)&quot;) as are filelists (Eg.
&quot;/usr/bin/yum&quot;). Also note that for filelists,
wildcards will match multiple packages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Because install
does a lot of work to make it as easy as possible to use,
there are also a few specific install commands
&quot;<b>install-n</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>install-na</b>&quot;
and &quot;<b>install-nevra</b>&quot;. These only work on
package names, and do not process wildcards etc.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>update</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>If run without any packages, update will update every
currently installed package. If one or more packages or
package globs are specified, Yum will only update the listed
packages. While updating packages, <b>yum</b> will ensure
that all dependencies are satisfied. (See <b>Specifying
package names</b> for more information) If the packages or
globs specified match to packages which are not currently
installed then update will not install them. update operates
on groups, files, provides and filelists just like the
&quot;install&quot; command.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the main
obsoletes configure option is true (default) or the
&minus;&minus;obsoletes flag is present <b>yum</b> will
include package obsoletes in its calculations - this makes
it better for distro&minus;version changes, for example:
upgrading from somelinux 8.0 to somelinux 9.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
&quot;<b>update</b>&quot; works on installed packages first,
and only if there are no matches does it look for available
packages. The difference is most noticeable when you do
&quot;<b>update</b> foo-1-2&quot; which will act exactly as
&quot;<b>update</b> foo&quot; if foo-1-2 is installed. You
can use the &quot;<b>update-to</b>&quot; if you&rsquo;d
prefer that nothing happen in the above case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>update-to</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command works like
&quot;<b>update</b>&quot; but always specifies the version
of the package we want to update to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>update-minimal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This works like the update
command, but if you have the package foo-1 installed and
have foo-2 (bugfix) and foo-3 (enhancement) available with
updateinfo.xml then update-minimal --bugfix will update you
to foo-2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>check&minus;update</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Implemented so you could know
if your machine had any updates that needed to be applied
without running it interactively. Returns exit value of 100
if there are packages available for an update. Also returns
a list of the packages to be updated in list format. Returns
0 if no packages are available for update. Returns 1 if an
error occurred. Running in verbose mode also shows
obsoletes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>upgrade</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Is the same as the update
command with the &minus;&minus;obsoletes flag set. See
update for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>upgrade-to</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command works like
&quot;<b>upgrade</b>&quot; but always specifies the version
of the package we want to update to.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>distribution&minus;synchronization</b>
or <b>distro&minus;sync</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Synchronizes the installed
package set with the latest packages available, this is done
by either obsoleting, upgrading or downgrading as
appropriate. This will &quot;normally&quot; do the same
thing as the upgrade command however if you have the package
FOO installed at version 4, and the latest available is only
version 3, then this command will <b>downgrade</b> FOO to
version 3.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you give the
optional argument &quot;full&quot;, then the command will
also reinstall packages where the install checksum and the
available checksum do not match. And remove old packages
(can be used to sync. rpmdb versions). The optional argument
&quot;different&quot; can be used to specify the default
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This command
does not perform operations on groups, local packages or
negative selections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>remove</b> or
<b>erase</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Are used to remove the
specified packages from the system as well as removing any
packages which depend on the package being removed. remove
operates on groups, files, provides and filelists just like
the &quot;install&quot; command.(See <b>Specifying package
names</b> for more information)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
&quot;yum&quot; is included in the protected_packages
configuration, by default. So you can&rsquo;t accidentally
remove yum itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
remove_leaf_only configuration changes the behaviour of this
command to only remove packages which aren&rsquo;t required
by something else.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
clean_requirements_on_remove configuration changes the
behaviour of this command to also remove packages that are
only dependencies of this package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Because remove
does a lot of work to make it as easy as possible to use,
there are also a few specific remove commands
&quot;<b>remove-n</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>remove-na</b>&quot;
and &quot;<b>remove-nevra</b>&quot;. These only work on
package names, and do not process wildcards etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>autoremove</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With one or
more arguments this command works like running the
&quot;<b>remove</b>&quot; command with the
clean_requirements_on_remove turned on. However you can also
specify no arguments, at which point it tries to remove any
packages that weren&rsquo;t installed explicitly by the user
and which aren&rsquo;t required by anything (so called leaf
packages).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Because
autoremove does a lot of work to make it as easy as possible
to use, there are also a few specific autoremove commands
&quot;<b>autoremove-n</b>&quot;,
&quot;<b>autoremove-na</b>&quot; and
&quot;<b>autoremove-nevra</b>&quot;. These only work on
package names, and do not process wildcards etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>provides</b> or

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Is used to find out which
package provides some feature or file. Just use a specific
name or a file-glob-syntax wildcards to list the packages
available or installed that provide that feature or
file.</p>

summaries, but if that &quot;fails&quot; it will then try
descriptions and url.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Yum search

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>makecache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Is used to download and make
usable all the metadata for the currently enabled <b>yum</b>
repos. If the argument &quot;fast&quot; is passed, then we
just try to make sure the repos. are current (much like
&quot;yum clean expire-cache&quot;).</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>groups</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>A command, new in 3.4.2, that collects all the
subcommands that act on groups together. Note that recent
yum using distributions (Fedora-19+, RHEL-7+) have
configured group_command=objects which changes how group
commands act in some important ways.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
install</b>&quot; is used to install all of the individual
packages in a group, of the specified types (this works as
if you&rsquo;d taken each of those package names and put
them on the command line for a &quot;yum install&quot;
command). <br>
The group_package_types configuration option specifies which
types will be installed. <br>
If you wish to &quot;reinstall&quot; a group so that you get
a package that is currently blacklisted the easiest way to
do that currently is to install the package manually and
then run &quot;groups mark packages-sync mygroup
mypackagename&quot; (or use yumdb to set the group_member of
the package(s)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
update</b>&quot; is just an alias for group install, when
using group_command=compat. This will install packages in
the group not already installed and upgrade existing
packages. With group_command=simple it will just upgrade
already installed packages. With group_command=objects it
will try to upgrade the group object, installing any
available packages not blacklisted (marked &rsquo;-&rsquo;
in group info) and will upgrade the installed packages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
list</b>&quot; is used to list the available groups from all
<b>yum</b> repos. When group_command=objects the group is
installed if the user explicitly installed it (or used the
group mark* commands to mark it installed). It does not need
to have any packages installed. When not using
group_command=objects groups are shown as
&quot;installed&quot; if all mandatory packages are
installed, or if a group doesn&rsquo;t have any mandatory
packages then it is installed if any of the optional or
default package are installed (when not in
group_command=objects mode). You can pass optional arguments
to the list/summary commands: installed, available,
environment, language, packages, hidden and ids (or any of
those prefixed by &quot;no&quot; to turn them off again). If
you pass the &minus;v option, to enable verbose mode, then
the groupids are displayed by default (but &quot;yum group
list ids&quot; is often easier to read).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
remove</b>&quot; is used to remove all of the packages in a
group, unlike &quot;groupinstall&quot; this will remove
everything regardless of group_package_types. It is worth
pointing out that packages can be in more than one group, so
&quot;group install X Y&quot; followed by &quot;group remove
Y&quot; does not do give you the same result as &quot;group
install X&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
groupremove_leaf_only configuration changes the behaviour of
this command to only remove packages which aren&rsquo;t
required by something else.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
info</b>&quot; is used to give the description and package
list of a group (and which type those packages are marked
as). Note that you can use the yum-filter-data and
yum-list-data plugins to get/use the data the other way
around (i.e. what groups own packages need updating). If you
pass the &minus;v option, to enable verbose mode, then the
package names are matched against installed/available
packages similar to the list command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When using
group_command=objects, the info command will display markers
next to each package saying how that package relates to the
group object. The meaning of these markers is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;-&quot; =
Package isn&rsquo;t installed, and won&rsquo;t be installed
as part of the group (Eg. &quot;yum group install foo
-pkgA&quot; or &quot;yum group install foo; yum remove
pkgA&quot; &#8230; this will have pkgA marked as
&rsquo;-&rsquo;) <br>
&quot;+&quot; = Package isn&rsquo;t installed, but will be
the next time you run &quot;yum upgrade&quot; or &quot;yum
group upgrade foo&quot; <br>
&quot; &quot; = Package is installed, but wasn&rsquo;t
installed via the group (so &quot;group remove foo&quot;
won&rsquo;t remove it). <br>
&quot;=&quot; = Package is installed, and was installed via
the group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">you can move an
installed package into an installed group using either
&quot;group mark package-sync/package-sync-forced&quot; or
&quot;yumdb set group_member&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
summary</b>&quot; is used to give a quick summary of how
many groups are installed and available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
mark</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>group unmark</b>&quot; are used
when groups are configured in group_command=objects mode.
These commands then allow you to alter yum&rsquo;s idea of
which groups are installed, and the packages that belong to
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
mark install</b>&quot; mark the group as installed. When
installed &quot;<b>yum upgrade</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>yum
group upgrade</b>&quot; will install new packages for the
group (only those packages already installed will be marked
as members of the installed group to start with).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
mark remove</b>&quot; the opposite of mark install.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
mark packages</b>&quot; takes a group id (which must be
installed) and marks any given installed packages (which
aren&rsquo;t members of a group) as members of the group.
Note that the data from the repositories does not need to
specify the packages as a member of the group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
mark packages-force</b>&quot; works like mark packages, but
doesn&rsquo;t care if the packages are already members of
another group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
mark blacklist</b>&quot; will blacklist all packages marked
to be installed for a group. After this command a &quot;yum
group upgrade&quot; will not install any new packages as
part of the group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
mark convert-blacklist</b>&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
mark convert-whitelist</b>&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
mark convert</b>&quot; converts the automatic data you get
without using groups as objects into groups as objects data,
in other words this will make &quot;yum
--setopt=group_command=objects groups list&quot; look as
similar as possible to the current output of &quot;yum
--setopt=group_command=simple groups list&quot;. This makes
it much easier to convert to groups as objects without
having to reinstall. For groups that are installed the
whitelist variant will mark all uninstalled packages for the
group as to be installed on the next &quot;yum group
upgrade&quot;, the blacklist variant (current default) will
mark them all as blacklisted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;<b>group
unmark packages</b>&quot; remove a package as a member from
any groups.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>resolvedep</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Is used to list packages
providing the specified dependencies, at most one package is
listed per dependency. This command is maintained for legacy
reasons only, use repoquery instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>localinstall</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Is used to install a set of
local rpm files. If required the enabled repositories will
be used to resolve dependencies. Note that the install
command will do a local install, if given a filename. This
command is maintained for legacy reasons only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>localupdate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Is used to update the system by
specifying local rpm files. Only the specified rpm files of
which an older version is already installed will be
installed, the remaining specified packages will be ignored.
If required the enabled repositories will be used to resolve
dependencies. Note that the update command will do a local
update, if given a filename. This command is maintained for
legacy reasons only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>reinstall</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Will reinstall the identically
versioned package as is currently installed. This does not
work for &quot;installonly&quot; packages, like Kernels.
reinstall operates on groups, files, provides and filelists
just like the &quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>downgrade</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Will try and downgrade a
package from the version currently installed to the
previously highest version (or the specified version). The
depsolver will not necessarily work, but if you specify all
the packages it should work (thus, all the simple cases will
work). Also this does not work for &quot;installonly&quot;
packages, like Kernels. downgrade operates on groups, files,
provides, filelists and rpm files just like the
&quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p>At it&rsquo;s simplest this is just a simpler way to
remove one set of package(s) and install another set of
package(s) without having to use the &quot;shell&quot;
command. However you can specify different commands to call
than just remove or install, and you can list multiple
packages (it splits using the &quot;--&quot; marker). Note
that option parsing will remove the first &quot;--&quot; in
an argument list on the command line.</p></td></tr>

swap -- group remove foo-grp -- group install bar-grp</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>deplist</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Produces a list of all
dependencies and what packages provide those dependencies
for the given packages. As of 3.2.30 it now just shows the
latest version of each package that matches (this can be
changed by using --showduplicates) and it only shows the
newest providers (which can be changed by using
--verbose).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>repolist</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Produces a list of configured
repositories. The default is to list all enabled
repositories. If you pass &minus;v, for verbose mode, or use
repoinfo then more information is listed. If the first
argument is &acute;enabled&acute;, &acute;disabled&acute; or
&acute;all&acute; then the command will list those types of
repos.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">You can pass
repo id or name arguments, or wildcards which to match
against both of those. However if the id or name matches
exactly then the repo will be listed even if you are listing
enabled repos. and it is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In non-verbose
mode the first column will start with a &acute;*&acute; if
the repo. has metalink data and the latest metadata is not
local and will start with a &acute;!&acute; if the repo. has
metadata that is expired. For non-verbose mode the last
column will also display the number of packages in the repo.
and (if there are any user specified excludes) the number of
packages excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">One last
special feature of repolist, is that if you are in
non-verbose mode then yum will ignore any repo errors and
output the information it can get (Eg. &quot;yum clean all;
yum -C repolist&quot; will output something, although the
package counts/etc. will be zeroed out).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>repoinfo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This command
works exactly like repolist -v.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>repository&minus;packages</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Treat a repo. as a collection
of packages (like &quot;yum groups&quot;) allowing the user
to install or remove them as a single entity.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository&minus;packages
&lt;repo&gt; list&quot; - Works like the &quot;yum
list&quot; command, but only shows packages from the given
repository.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository&minus;packages
&lt;repo&gt; info&quot; - Works like the &quot;yum
info&quot; command, but only shows packages from the given
repository.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository&minus;packages
&lt;repo&gt; check-update&quot; - Works like the &quot;yum
check-update&quot; command, but only shows packages from the
given repository.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository&minus;packages
&lt;repo&gt; install&quot; - Install all of the packages in
the repository, basically the same as: yum install
$(repoquery --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a). Specific
packages/wildcards can be specified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository&minus;packages
&lt;repo&gt; upgrade&quot; - Update all of the packages in
the repository, basically the same as: yum upgrade
$(repoquery --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a). Specific
packages/wildcards can be specified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository&minus;packages
&lt;repo&gt; upgrade-to&quot; - Update all of the packages
in the repository, basically the same as: yum upgrade
$(repoquery --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a). Without arguments it
works the same as upgrade, with arguments it just interprets
them as the versions you want to move to.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository&minus;packages
&lt;repo&gt; reinstall-old&quot; - ReInstall all of the
packages that are installed from the repository and
available in the repository, similar to: yum reinstall
$(yumdb search-quiet from_repo &lt;repo&gt;).</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository&minus;packages
&lt;repo&gt; move-to&quot; - ReInstall all of the packages
that are available in the repository, basically the same as:
yum reinstall $(repoquery --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a).</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository&minus;packages
&lt;repo&gt; reinstall&quot; - Tries to do reinstall-old,
but if that produces no packages then tries move-to.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;repo&minus;pkgs
&lt;repo&gt; remove&quot; - Remove all of the packages in
the repository, very similar to: yum remove $(repoquery
--repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a). However the
repopkgsremove_leaf_only option is obeyed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;repo&minus;pkgs
&lt;repo&gt; remove-or-reinstall&quot; - Works like remove
for any package that doesn&rsquo;t have the exact same
version in another repository. For any package that does
have the exact NEVRA in another repository then that version
will be reinstalled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;repo&minus;pkgs
&lt;repo&gt; remove-or-distro-sync&quot; - Works like remove
for any package that doesn&rsquo;t exist in another
repository. For any package that does exist it tries to work
as if distro-sync was called (with the repo. disabled).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Produces a &quot;version&quot;
of the rpmdb, and of the enabled repositories if
&quot;all&quot; is given as the first argument. You can also
specify version groups in the version-groups configuration
file. If you pass &minus;v, for verbose mode, more
information is listed. The version is calculated by taking
an SHA1 hash of the packages (in sorted order), and the
checksum_type/checksum_data entries from the yumdb. Note
that this rpmdb version is now also used significantly
within yum (esp. in yum history).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The version
command will now show &quot;groups&quot; of packages as a
separate version, and so takes sub-commands:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;version
grouplist&quot; - List the defined version groups.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;version
groupinfo&quot; - Get the complete list of packages within
one or more version groups.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;version
installed&quot; - This is the default, only show the version
information for installed packages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;version
available&quot; - Only show the version information for
available packages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;version
all&quot; - Show the version information for installed and
available packages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;version
nogroups | nogroups-*&quot; - Just show the main version
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;version
group-*&quot; - Just show the grouped version information,
if more arguments are given then only show the data for
those groups.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>history</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The history command allows the
user to view what has happened in past transactions
(assuming the history_record config. option is set). You can
use info/list/packages-list/packages-info/summary to view
what happened, undo/redo/rollback to act on that information
and new to start a new history file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
info/list/summary commands take either a transaction id or a
package (with wildcards, as in <b>Specifying package
names</b>), all three can also be passed no arguments. list
can be passed the keyword &quot;all&quot; to list all the
transactions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The info
command can also take ranges of transaction ids, of the form
start..end, which will then display a merged history as if
all the transactions in the range had happened at once. <br>
Eg. &quot;history info 1..4&quot; will merge the first four
transactions and display them as a single transaction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
packages-list/packages-info commands takes a package (with
wildcards, as in <b>Specifying package names</b>). And show
data from the point of view of that package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
undo/redo/rollback commands take either a single transaction
id or the keyword last and an offset from the last
transaction (Eg. if you&rsquo;ve done 250 transactions,
&quot;last&quot; refers to transaction 250, and
&quot;last-4&quot; refers to transaction 246). The redo
command can also take some optional arguments before you
specify the transaction. &quot;force-reinstall&quot; tells
it reinstall any packages that were installed in that
transaction (via install, upgrade or downgrade).
&quot;force-remove&quot; tells it to forcibly remove any
packages that were updated or downgraded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The undo/redo
commands act on the specified transaction, undo&rsquo;ing or
repeating the work of that transaction. While the rollback
command will undo all transactions up to the point of the
specified transaction. For example, if you have 3
transactions, where package A; B and C where installed
respectively. Then &quot;undo 1&quot; will try to remove
package A, &quot;redo 1&quot; will try to install package A
(if it is not still installed), and &quot;rollback 1&quot;
will try to remove packages B and C. Note that after a
&quot;rollback 1&quot; you will have a fourth transaction,
although the ending rpmdb version (see: yum version) should
be the same in transactions 1 and 4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The addon-info
command takes a transaction ID, and the packages-list
command takes a package (with wildcards).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The stats
command shows some statistics about the current history
DB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The sync
commands allows you to change the rpmdb/yumdb data stored
for any installed packages, to whatever is in the current
rpmdb/yumdb (this is mostly useful when this data was not
stored when the package went into the history DB).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In
&quot;history list&quot; you can change the behaviour of the
2nd column via the configuration option
history_list_view.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In
&quot;history list&quot; output the Altered column also
gives some extra information if there was something not good
with the transaction (this is also shown at the end of the
package column in the packages-list command).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&gt;</b> -
The rpmdb was changed, outside yum, after the transaction.
<b><br>
&lt;</b> - The rpmdb was changed, outside yum, before the
transaction. <b><br>
*</b> - The transaction aborted before completion. <b><br>
#</b> - The transaction completed, but with a non-zero
status. <b><br>
E</b> - The transaction completed fine, but had
warning/error output during the transaction. <b><br>
P</b> - The transaction completed fine, but problems already
existed in the rpmdb. <b><br>
s</b> - The transaction completed fine, but --skip-broken
was enabled and had to skip some packages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>load-transaction</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command will re-load a
saved yum transaction file, this allows you to run a
transaction on one machine and then use it on another. The
two common ways to get a saved yum transaction file are from
&quot;yum -q history addon-info last saved_tx&quot; or via
the automatic saves in $TMPDIR/yum_save_tx.* when a
transaction is solved but not run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Running the
command without an argument, or a directory as an argument
will try and list the possible files available to load.
Showing if the packages are still available, if the rpmdb
matches the current rpmdb, how many transaction
install/removes members are in the saved transaction and
what the filename is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>updateinfo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command has a bunch of
sub-commands to act on the updateinfo in the repositories.
The simplest commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">yum updateinfo
info [all | available | installed | updates] <br>
yum updateinfo list [all | available | installed | updates]
<br>
yum updateinfo [summary] [all | available | installed |
updates]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">which all
display information about the available update information
relevant to your machine (including anything installed, if
you supply &quot;all&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>* all</b> Is
used to display information about both install and available
advisories. <b><br>
* available</b> Is used to display information about just
available advisories. This is the default. <b><br>
* installed</b> Is used to display information about just
install advisories. <b><br>
* updates</b> This is mostly the same as
&quot;available&quot; but it only shows advisory information
for packages that can be updated to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">They all take
as arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>*
&lt;advisory&gt; [advisory...]</b> Is used to display
information about one or more advisories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>*
&lt;package&gt; [package...]</b> Is used to display
information about one or more packages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>* bugzillas
/ bzs</b> Is the subset of the updateinfo information,
pertaining to the bugzillas.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>* cves</b>
Is the subset of the updateinfo information, pertaining to
the CVEs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>*
enhancement</b> Is the subset of the updateinfo information,
pertaining to enhancements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>* bugfix</b>
Is the subset of the updateinfo information, pertaining to
bugfixes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>* security /
sec</b> Is the subset of the updateinfo information,
pertaining to security.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>* severity /
sev</b> Include security relevant packages of this
severity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>*
recommended</b> Is the subset of the updateinfo information,
pertaining to recommended updates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>*
new-packages</b> Is the subset of the updateinfo
information, pertaining to new packages. These are packages
which weren&rsquo;t available at the initial release of your
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">There are also
three sub-commands to remove packages when using &quot;yum
shell&quot;, they are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">yum updateinfo
remove-pkgs-ts</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">yum updateinfo
exclude-updates</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">yum updateinfo
exclude-all</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">they all take
the following arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">* [bzs=foo]
[advisories=foo] [cves=foo] [security-severity=foo]
[security] [bugfix]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">and finally
there is a command to manually check the running kernel
against updateinfo data:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">yum updateinfo
check-running-kernel</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>fssnapshot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command has a few
sub-commands to act on the LVM data of the host, to list
snapshots and the create and remove them. The simplest
commands, to display information about the configured LVM
snapshotable devices, are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">yum fssnapshot
[summary] <br>
yum fssnapshot list <br>
yum fssnapshot have-space</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">then you can
create and delete snapshots using:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">yum fssnap
create <br>
yum fssnap delete &lt;device(s)&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Configuration
Options: <b>fssnap_automatic_pre</b>,
<b>fssnap_automatic_post</b>, <b>fssnap_automatic_keep</b>,
<b>fssnap_percentage</b>, <b>fssnap_devices</b>,
<b>fssnap_abort_on_errors</b></p>

refilter command is an optimized way of calling &quot;yum

because rpm doesn&rsquo;t actually remove the files on
reinstall, as it should. And the du/status/diff commands are
included so you can easily see the space used/saved and any
other changes.</p>

combined with &minus;&minus;installroot. You can also use
&minus;&minus;releasever=/ to take the releasever
information from outside the installroot. Note that with the
default upstream cachedir, of /var/cache/yum, using this
option will corrupt your cache (and you can use $releasever
in your cachedir configuration to stop this).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;t,
&minus;&minus;tolerant</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option makes yum go
slower, checking for things that shouldn&rsquo;t be possible

<h2>PLUGINS
<a name="PLUGINS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Yum can be
extended through the use of plugins. A plugin is a Python
&quot;.py&quot; file which is installed in one of the
directories specified by the <b>pluginpath</b> option in
yum.conf. For a plugin to work, the following conditions
must be met:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. The plugin
module file must be installed in the plugin path as just
described.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. The global
<b>plugins</b> option in /etc/yum.conf must be set to
&lsquo;1&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3. A
configuration file for the plugin must exist in
/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/&lt;plugin_name&gt;.conf and the
<b>enabled</b> setting in this file must set to
&lsquo;1&rsquo;. The minimal content for such a
configuration file is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">[main] <br>
enabled = 1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the
